<h2 class="gap4">PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</h2>


<p>It cannot be urged against this work that it travels
along a path already well worn, for the subject of
trees and shrubs for English gardens, though almost
inexhaustible, has never been so fully treated and
illustrated as it deserves. The book may have many
defects, but its pages will show that an honest
effort has been made to offer helpful and instructive
information to the many who wish to know more of
the beauty of trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>In writing this book, the labour of my spare hours
for many months, I have been greatly helped by
Mr. Bean, the assistant-curator of the Royal Gardens,
Kew, whose deep knowledge of the subject has been
willingly imparted; and by Miss Jekyll, to whom I
am indebted for many valuable suggestions and
notes. Among others to whom grateful thanks are
tendered are Mrs. Davidson, Mr. J. Clark, Mr.
Dallimore, and Mr. S. W. Fitzherbert.</p>

<p>Some of the chapters have already appeared in
the <i>Garden</i>, with the object of making known as
widely as possible the importance of the most beautiful
trees and shrubs for English woodland and
pleasure-grounds.</p>

<p>The illustrations will show how a shrub, so often
stunted and mutilated by unwise pruning, becomes
beautiful when allowed to develop naturally.</p>

<p>The illustrations have their own teaching value,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
and in this matter also I desire to thank many willing
helpers, especially Miss Jekyll, Miss Willmott, and Mr.
Crump, of the Madresfield Court Gardens. Many
of them are from photographs taken in the Royal
Gardens, Kew. Under the present director (Sir
William Thiselton-Dyer) much has been done in
the judicious grouping of plants. Here is a living
place of instruction open to all.</p>

<p>Those who desire to know more about trees and
shrubs than it is possible to give in this book should
consult such famous works as Loudon's "Arboretum
Britannicum" (8 vols.), and "Encyclopædia of Trees
and Shrubs"; Professor Sargent's "Silva of North
America," and "Forest Flora of Japan"; "Manual
of Coniferæ," by Messrs. James Veitch &amp; Sons;
"The Pinetum," by George Gordon; The "Bamboo
Garden," by Lord Redesdale; Sir Joseph Hooker's
"Rhododendrons of the Sikkim Himalaya"; and the
excellent Kew Hand-list of Trees and Shrubs. Much
information can also be gleaned from the volumes of
<i>Garden and Forest</i> (American), edited by Professor
Sargent, but not now in publication.</p>

<p>The nomenclature at Kew&mdash;that is, according to
the <i>Index Kewensis</i>&mdash;is that adopted in this book.</p>

<p>It is the wish and hope of the author, whose notes,
taken during many years, are embodied, that the book
may do something to make English gardens more
beautiful and interesting, and that it may win many
to see the better ways of planting; also that it may
be the means of bringing forward the many trees
and shrubs of rare charm that are generally unknown
or unheeded.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>This edition has been thoroughly revised to render
it as useful as possible to those who desire a larger
acquaintance with the many beautiful trees and
shrubs that are hardy in this country. I must tender
my heartiest thanks to Mr. William Atkinson (Messrs.
Fisher, Son, &amp; Sibray) for his valuable help in preparing
this edition. Many of the illustrations represent
trees and shrubs in the Royal Gardens, Kew,
which are not only beautiful in themselves, but are
the centre of scientific research.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">TREES AND SHRUBS</h2>



<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">WANT OF VARIETY A BLEMISH</h3>


<p>There is a sad want of variety amongst evergreen
and deciduous shrubs in the average English garden.
Faith is placed in a few shrubs with a reputation for
robbing the soil of its goodness and making a monotonous
ugly green bank, neither pleasant to look at
nor of any protective value. As one who knows
shrubs well and the way to group them says, "Even
the landscape gardeners, the men who have the
making of gardens&mdash;with, of course, notable exceptions&mdash;do
not seem to know the rich storehouse to
draw from." Very true is this. We see evidence
of it every day. The mixed shrubbery is fondly
clung to as a place for all shrubs, whether flowering
or otherwise, and the result is a thicket of growths,
a case indeed of a survival of the fittest. There
are other shrubs than Privet in this fair world of
ours, and as for providing shelter, the wind whistles
through its bare stems and creates a draught good
for neither man, beast, nor plant. Of the cherry
laurel again there is far too much in gardens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Few other plants can stand against its greedy,
searching roots, and its vigorous branches and big
leaves kill other leaf-growth near them. Grown
in the proper way, that is, as an isolated shrub,
with abundance of space to develop its graceful
branches and brilliant green leaves, the Cherry
Laurel is a beautiful evergreen; it is quite happy
in shady, half-wooded places. But grown, as it is
so often, jammed up and smothering other things,
or held in bounds by a merciless and beauty-destroying
knife, its presence has not been to the
advantage of English gardening.</p>

<p>When the planting season comes round, think of
some of the good shrubs not yet in the garden, and
forget pontic Rhododendron, Laurel, Aucuba, and
Privet. By this is not meant rare shrubs, such as
may only be had from the few nurseries of the very
highest rank or from those that make rare shrubs a
speciality, but good things that may be grown in any
garden and that appear in all good shrub catalogues.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">CHINESE GUELDER ROSE.</p>

<p>Perhaps no beautiful and now well-known shrub is
more neglected than beautiful <i>Exochorda grandiflora</i>
(the Pearl Bush). Its near relatives, the Spiræas, are
in every shrubbery, but one may go through twenty
and not see Exochorda. Even of the Spiræas one
does not half often see enough of <i>S. Thunbergi</i>, a
perfect milky way of little starry bloom in April and
a most shapely little bush, or the double-flowered <i>S.
prunifolia</i>, with its long wreaths of flower-like double
thorn or minute white roses and its autumn bravery
of scarlet foliage. The hardy Magnolias are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
given the opportunity they deserve of making our
gardens lovely in earliest summer. Who that has
seen <i>Magnolia stellata</i> in its April dress of profuse
white bloom and its summer and autumn dignity of
handsome though not large foliage, would endure to
be without it? or who would not desire to have the
fragrant chalices of <i>M. soulangeana</i>, with their outside
staining of purple, and <i>M. conspicua</i>, of purest white
in the early months of March and April? And why
does not every garden hold one, at least, of the sweet
<i>Chimonanthus</i>, offering, as it does in February, an
abundance of its little blooms of a fragrance so rich
and powerful that it can be scarcely matched throughout
the year?</p>

<p class="caption">A GROUPING OF MAGNOLIA STELLATA.</p>

<p><i>Cassinia fulvida</i>, still known in nurseries by its
older name of Diplopappus, in winter wears its
fullest dress of tiny gold-backed leafage in long
graceful sprays, that are borne in such profusion
that they only beg to be cut to accompany the rare
flowers of winter that we bring indoors to sweeten
and enliven our rooms.</p>

<p>Of small-flowering trees none is lovelier than
the Snowy Mespilus (<i>Amelanchier</i>), and for a tree of
somewhat larger size the good garden form of the
native Bird Cherry is beautiful in the early year.
The North American <i>Halesia</i> (the Snowdrop Tree)
should be in every garden, either as a bush or tree,
every branch hung in May with its full array of
pendent bloom of the size and general shape of
Snowdrops, only of a warm and almost creamy
instead of a cold snow-white colour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Few spring-flowering shrubs are more free and
graceful than <i>Forsythia suspensa</i>, and if it can be
planted on a slight eminence and encouraged to
throw down its many-feet-long graceful sprays it
then exhibits its best garden use. The Chinese
<i>Viburnum plicatum</i> is another shrub well known but
unfairly neglected, flowering with the earliest Irises.
Grouped with the grand <i>Iris pallida dalmatica</i> it is a
thing never to be forgotten.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">ÆSCULUS PARVIFLORA (late July).</p>

<p><i>Æsculus (Pavia) parviflora</i>, blooming in July when
flowering shrubs are rare, is easily grown and
strikingly handsome, and yet how rarely seen! <i>Calycanthus
floridus</i>, with its spice-scented blooms of low-toned
crimson, also a late summer flower, is a fine
thing in a cool, well-sheltered corner, where the sun
cannot burn the flowers. The Rose Acacia (<i>Robinia
hispida</i>), trained on a wall or house, is as beautiful as
any Wistaria, and the quality of the low-toned rosy
bloom of a much rarer colour. It is quite hardy,
but so brittle that it needs close and careful wall
training or other support. To name a few others in
the same kind of category, but rather less hardy, the
Sweet Bay is the noblest of evergreen bushes or
small trees; the Tamarisk, with its grey plumes of
foliage and summer flower-plumes of tenderest pink,
is a delightful plant in our southern counties, doing
especially well near the sea. <i>Clethra alnifolia</i>, against
a wall or in the open, is a mass of flower in late
summer, and the best of the <i>Hibiscus syriacus</i>, or
<i>Althæa frutex</i>, the shrubbery representatives of
Mallows and Hollyhocks, are autumn flowers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
best class. A bushy plant of half-woody character
that may well be classed among shrubs, and that was
beloved of our grandmothers, is <i>Leycesteria formosa</i>, a
delightful thing in the later autumn. The large-fruited
Euonymus (Spindle Tree) is another good
thing too little grown.</p>

<p class="caption">DOUBLE-FLOWERED SLOE OR BLACKTHORN.</p>

<p>For a peaty garden there are many delightful
plants in the neglected though easy-to-be-had list.
One of these is the beautiful and highly fragrant
<i>Azalea occidentalis</i>, all the better that the flowers and
leaves come together and that it is later than the
Ghent Azaleas. Then there are the two sweet-scented
North American Bog Myrtles, <i>Myrica cerifera</i>
and <i>Comptonia asplenifolia</i>, the charming little <i>Leiophyllum
buxifolium</i>, of neatest bushy form, and the
<i>Ledum palustre</i>, whose bruised leaves are of delightful
aromatic fragrance; <i>Vaccinium pennsylvanicum</i>, pretty
in leaf and flower and blazing scarlet in autumn, and
<i>Gaultheria Shallon</i>, a most important sub-shrub, revelling
in moist peat or any cool sandy soil.</p>

<p>These examples by no means exhaust the list of
desirable shrubs that may be found for the slightest
seeking. This brief recital of their names and
qualities is only meant as a reminder that all these
good things are close at hand, while many more are
only waiting to be asked for.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">ORNAMENTAL PLANTING IN WOODLAND</h3>


<p>Where woodland adjoins garden ground, and the
one passes into the other by an almost imperceptible
gradation, a desire is often felt to let the garden
influence penetrate some way into the wood by the
planting within the wood of some shrubs or trees
of distinctly ornamental character.</p>

<p>Such a desire very naturally arises&mdash;it is wild
gardening with the things of larger growth; but,
like all forms of wild gardening (which of all branches
of gardening is the most difficult to do rightly, and
needs the greatest amount of knowledge), the wishes
of the planter must be tempered with extreme precaution
and restraint. It does not do to plant in
the wild garden things of well-known garden character.
This is merely to spoil the wood, which, in
many cases, is already so good that any addition
would be a tasteless intrusion of something irrelevant
and unsuitable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;"><a id="image0006" name="image0006" href="images/illus0027.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">IN THE WOODLAND AT KEW, SHOWING TREE AND SHRUB BY GRASSY WAY.</p>

<p>Still, there are certain wooded places where a
judicious planting would be a gain, and there are
a certain number of trees and shrubs which those
who have a fair knowledge of their ways, and a
true sympathy with the nature of woodland, recognise
as suitable for this kind of planting. They will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
found in these classes: Native growths that are absent
or unusual in the district, such as the Spindle Tree
(<i>Euonymus</i>), White Beam, Service Tree, White and
Black Thorn, Wild Cherry, Bird Cherry, Wild Guelder
Rose (<i>Viburnum Opulus</i>), and <i>V. Lantana</i>, Honeysuckle,
Wild Roses, Juniper, and <i>Daphne Laureola</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 222px;"><a id="image0007" name="image0007" href="images/illus0028.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">WAYFARING TREE (Viburnum Lantana); A NATIVE SHRUB ON CHALK.</p>

<p>Then, among cultivated trees and shrubs, those that
are nearly related to our wild kinds, including some
that are found in foreign woodlands that have about
the same latitude and climate as our own. Among
these will be Quinces and Medlars, many kinds of
ornamental Cratægus, Scarlet Oaks, various Elders
and Crabs, and the grand <i>Pyrus americana</i>, so like our
native Mountain Ash, but on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>A very careful planting with trees and shrubs of
some of these and, perhaps, other allied kinds, may
give additional beauty and interest to woodland.
Differences of soil will, of course, be carefully
considered, for if a piece of woodland were on
chalky soil, a totally different selection should be
made from one that would be right for a soil that
was poor and sandy.</p>

<p>In moist, sandy, or, still better, peaty ground,
especially where there is a growth of Birches and
Scotch Firs, and not many other kinds of trees, a
plantation of Rhododendrons may have a fine effect.
But in this case it is better to use the common
<i>R. ponticum</i> only, as a mixture of differently coloured
kinds is sure to give a misplaced-garden look, or
an impression as if a bit of garden ground had
missed its way and got lost in the wood.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">GROUPING OF TREES AND SHRUBS</h3>


<p>If this subject were considered with only a reasonable
amount of thought, and the practice of it controlled
by good taste, there is nothing that would
do more for the beauty of our gardens or grounds.
Nothing can so effectually destroy good effect as the
usual senseless mixture of deciduous and evergreen
shrubs that, alas! is so commonly seen in gardens&mdash;a
mixture of one each of a quantity of perhaps
excellent things planted about three feet apart. There
would be nothing to be said against this if it were the
deliberate intention of any individual, for, as a garden
is for the owner's happiness, it is indisputably his
right to take his pleasure in it as he will, and if he
says, "I have only space for a hundred plants, and I
wish them to be all different," that is for him to
decide. But when the mixture is made from pure
ignorance or helplessness it is then that advice may
be of use, and that the assurance may be given that
there are better ways that are just as easy at the
beginning, and that with every year will be growing
on towards some definite scheme of beauty, instead
of merely growing up into a foolish tangle of horticultural
imbecility.</p>

<p>If the intending planter has no knowledge it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
well worth his while to take advice at the beginning,
not to plant at random and to feel, a few years later,
first doubt, and then regret, and then, as knowledge
grows, to have to face the fact that it is all wrong
and that much precious time has been lost.</p>

<p>How to group is a large question, depending on
all the conditions of the place under consideration.
Whether a group is to be of tall or short growing
shrubs or trees, whether it is to be of three or three
hundred, and so on. The knowledge that can answer
is the knowledge of gardening of the better kind.
The whole thing should be done carefully on paper
beforehand, or there will again be repented the error
of huddled single plants. The groups will have to
be well shaped and well sized and well related to
each other and all that is near, or they may be
merely a series of senseless blocks, not intelligently
formed groups at all.</p>

<p>Then, in proper relation to the groups, single
plants can be used with the best possible effect, as,
for instance, a snowy Mespilus or a Cherry or a
<i>Pyrus floribunda</i> against a dark massing of Yew or
Holly; or a <i>Forsythia suspensa</i> casting out its long
flowering branches from among bushes of <i>Berberis</i>.
Then the fewer individuals will have their full value,
while the larger masses will have dignity even when
in leaf only, and their own special beauty at the time
when they are in flower or fruit. For some flowering
and fruiting bushes are best grouped, while a few
are best seen standing alone, and it is only knowledge
of good gardening that can guide the designer in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
decisions on these points. Still it does not follow
that a shrub or flowering tree cannot be used both
for groups and single use, for such an one as the
Forsythia just mentioned is also of charming effect
in its own groups, with the red-tinted <i>Berberis</i> or the
quiet-coloured Savins, or whatever be the lower growing
bushy mass that is chosen to accompany it.
Every one can see the great gain of such arrangements
when they are made, but to learn to make
them, and even to perceive what are the plants to
group together, and why, that is the outcome of the
education of the garden artist.</p>

<p>In the Royal Gardens, Kew, the best of plants
may be seen and, to a considerable degree, the best
ways of using them in gardens.</p>

<p class="caption">GROUPING OF SHRUB AND DAFFODIL.</p>

<p>The one-thing-at-a-time planting is always a safe
guide, but as the planter gains a firmer grasp of his
subject, so he may exercise more freedom in its
application. Nearly every garden, shrubbery, and
ornamental tree plantation is spoilt or greatly marred
by too great a mixture of incongruous growths.
Nothing wants more careful consideration. On the
ground in the open air, and sitting at home quietly
thinking, the question should be carefully thought out.
The very worst thing to do is to take a nursery
catalogue and make out from it a list of supposed
wants. The right thing is to make a plan of the
ground, to scale, if possible, though a rougher one
may serve, and mark it all down in good time beforehand,
not to wait until the last moment and then
mark it; and not to send the list to the nursery till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the ground is well forward for planting, so that the
moment the plants come they may go to their
places.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 158px;"><a id="image0009" name="image0009" href="images/illus0034.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">NATURAL GROUPING OF SHRUB IN ROUGH GROUND.</p>

<p>All this planning and thinking should be done in
the summer, so that the list may go to the nursery
in September, which will enable the nurseryman to
supply the trees in the earliest and best of the planting
season.</p>

<p>How good it would be to plant a whole hill-side on
chalky soil with grand groupings of Yew or Box, or
with these intergrouped, and how easy afterwards to
run among these groupings of lesser shrubs; or to
plant light land with Scotch Fir and Holly, Thorn
and Juniper (just these few things grouped and
intergrouped); or wastes of sandhills near the sea
within our milder shores with Sea Buckthorn and
Tamarisk, and Monterey Cypress (<i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i>),
and long drifts of the handsome Blue Lyme
Grass.</p>

<p>A mile of sandy littoral might be transformed with
these few things, and no others than its own wild
growths, into a region of delight, where noble tree
form of rapid growth, tender colour of plume-like
branch and bloom and brilliant berry, and waving
blue grassy ribbons, equalling in value any of the lesser
Bamboos, would show a lesson of simple planting
such as is most to be desired but is rarely to be
seen.</p>

<p>The other and commoner way is nothing but a
muddle from beginning to end. A van-load of
shrubs arrives from the nursery&mdash;one of each or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
perhaps not more than six of any kind. No plan is
prepared, and the trees and shrubs are planted in the
usual weary mixture, without thought or design.
Generally there are three times too many for the
space. It is a cruel waste and misuse of good
things.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">HEATHY PATHS IN OUTER GARDEN SPACES</h3>


<p>The subject of heathy paths comes within the scope
of this book. We are not thinking of grass or gravel
paths, but those in pleasure-grounds that are beyond
the province of the trimly-kept garden, and yet have
to be somewhat tamed from the mere narrow track
such as serves for the gamekeeper on his rounds.
Paths of this kind admit of varied treatment. The
nature of the place and the requirements of those
who use the paths will determine their general nature,
and settle whether they are to be of turf or of something
that must be dry in all weathers. But grass
and gravel are not the only alternatives. One kind
of path not often seen, but always pleasant, and at
one time of year distinctly beautiful, can be made of
the Common Heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>). We know
of such a path, 12 feet wide and some hundreds of
feet long, carpeted with this native Heath, mown
once a year, and feeling like a thick pile carpet to
the feet; grey-green in summer, bronze-coloured in
late autumn, and in the second and third weeks of
August thickly set with short sprays of the low-toned
pink of the Heather bloom. It is not so dry as a
gravel path, but a good deal drier than grass, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
has a pleasant feeling of elasticity that is absent in
common turf.</p>

<p>Many are the pleasure-grounds in the south of
England and Scotland where the soil is sandy and,
perhaps, peaty. Any such can have these pleasant
heathy paths. We have even seen them on a poor
sandy clay, scarcely good enough to call loam, in
Sussex; for Calluna, unlike the other Heaths, will
grow willingly in clay. In the case quoted the plant
was wild in the place.</p>

<p>In a Fir wood, the bare earth carpeted with needles
always makes a suitable path, and one that is always
dry; the only thing to correct is to fill up any places
where the bare roots rise above the path level. For
in these informal paths, where we want to look about
and at the trees, there should be no danger of being
tripped up. The path, of whatever nature, should be
wide enough for two persons&mdash;5 feet to 6 feet is
ample; but it should have quite a different character
from the garden path, in that its edges are not defined
or straightened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 157px;"><a id="image0010" name="image0010" href="images/illus0039.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">SHRUB AND IRIS GROUPS BY WOODLAND.</p>

<p>One may often see in the outskirts of an old
garden a dense wood that once was only a growth of
shrubbery size. The walk was originally bordered
by a Box edging, and there may have been a strip of
flowers between it and the shrubs. Here and there
one may still see a yard or two of straggling Box
nearly 2 feet high. Of course, this edging should
have been removed as soon as the place became a
wood, for after a certain time its original use as a
formal edging to a trim plantation ceased to exist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is pleasanter in woodland than broad,
grassy ways, well enough levelled to insure safety to
an unheeding walker. In early spring, before the
grass has grown any height, here is the place where
Daffodils can best be seen and enjoyed, some in the
clear grass and some running back in wide drifts into
any side opening of the wood. If the grass is cut in
June, when the Daffodil foliage is ripe, and again
early in September, these two mowings will suffice
for the year.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 234px;"><a id="image0011" name="image0011" href="images/illus0040.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">AZALEA GARDEN AT KEW (early Summer).</p>

<p>In many woody places where shade is fairly thick,
if there is any grass it will probably be full of moss.
No path-carpet is more beautiful than a mossy one;
indeed, where grass walks from the garden pass into
woodland, the mossy character so sympathetic to the
wood should be treasured, and the moss should not
be scratched out with iron rakes. Often in the
lawn proper a mixture of moss and grass is desirable,
though one has been taught that all moss is hateful.
In such places, though it may be well to check
it by raking out every four or five years, it should
by no means be destroyed, for in the lawn spaces
adjoining trees or woodland the moss is right and
harmonious.</p>

<p>There are paths for the garden and paths for the
wood. A mistaken zeal that would insist on the
trimness of the straight-edged garden walk in woodland
or wild is just as much misplaced as if by
slothful oversight an accumulation of dead leaves
or other débris of natural decay were permitted to
remain in the region of formal terrace or parterre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Heath paths should be made by either planting
or sowing. The common ling (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>)
makes the best turf. If the ground is sown it should
be of nearly pure sandy peat, or weeds would be
troublesome. If the path is to be made by planting,
it should be done with two-year-old seedlings&mdash;nothing
larger&mdash;planted about 6 inches apart. The
path when grown should be mown with a machine
once a year, in autumn after the blooming time of
the heath. There must be no grass.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS IN POOR SOILS</h3>


<p>As there is vegetation to suit nearly all natural conditions,
so those who find they have to undertake
planting in poor, dry, hungry sands and gravels will
find that there are plenty of trees and shrubs that
can be used, though the choice is necessarily a more
restricted one than they might make on better land.
The very fact of the fewer number of available trees
and shrubs may even be a benefit in disguise, as by
obliging the planter to be more restricted in his
choice the planting scheme will be all the more
harmonious.</p>

<p>As to trees, Holly, Thorn, Juniper, Birch, Scotch
Fir, and Mountain Ash are found wild on the poorest
soils, and will even grow in almost pure sand. Oaks,
though they never grow to the dimensions of the
Oak of loamy woodlands, are abundant on poor soils,
where they have a character of their own that is full
of pictorial value. The lovely <i>Amelanchier</i>, daintiest
of small trees, revels in sandy woods, as does also
the Bird Cherry, another good native tree, while the
Wild Cherry becomes a forest tree of large size and
of loveliest bloom. Evergreen or <i>Holm Oak</i> and
<i>Arbutus</i> are excellent in the south of England, enjoying
the warmth and winter dryness of light soils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Garden shrubs in general can be grown, though
not so luxuriantly as on better soils, but some classes
are especially successful on poor land such as <i>Genista
virgata</i>. There are the Cistuses and Heaths, with
Lavender and Rosemary, in the drier parts, and in
the wetter places <i>Kalmias</i>, <i>Andromedas</i>, <i>Rhododendrons</i>,
<i>Ledums</i>, <i>Pernettyas</i>, and <i>Vacciniums</i>, with the Candleberry
Gale and the native Bog Myrtle, also Broom and
Gorse, especially the Double Gorse. These, which
are usually classed as peat shrubs, will succeed in
any sandy soil with the addition of leaf-mould, and
are among the most interesting and beautiful of our
garden shrubs.</p>

<p>Those who garden on poor and dry soils should
remember that though their ground has drawbacks
it has also some compensations. Such soils do not
dry in cracks and open fissures in hot weather, and
do not present a surface of soapy slides in wet;
they can be worked at all times of the year, except
in hard frost; they are easy to hoe and keep clean
of weeds and are pleasant and easy to work. They
correct the tendency of strong soils to the making
of a quantity of coarse rank growth, and they
encourage the production of a quantity of flowers
of good colour.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">PRUNING FLOWERING TREES AND SHRUBS</h3>


<p>The art of pruning properly is one that is acquired
by considerable practice and observation. The first
is necessary that the actual work may be well and
cleanly done, and it is only by observing the manner
and times of flowering of the different trees and
shrubs which go to constitute a well-kept pleasure-ground
that the proper time to prune can be
thoroughly understood. The manner of pruning
varies considerably, some pinning their faith to a
slanting cut towards a bud; some preferring a
straight cut; while others again are content with
simply slashing off the useless wood in the quickest
possible manner. The former is the best method,
as it does not present a surface for the lodgment
of water, an important point with those shrubs that
are of a pithy nature in the centre of the wood, as
the presence of water will quickly cause the stems to
rot and render the plant unsightly, even if it escapes
serious injury. All stems that are an inch or more
in diameter should be tarred over to keep out the
wet, which either rots them directly or injures them
indirectly by making a moist, congenial home for the
various fungoid diseases to which so many of our
exotic trees and shrubs are liable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Many shrubs which have been in one place for
some years, and which have become stunted or
poorly flowered, are often given a new lease of life
by a hard pruning in the winter, cutting away all
the old wood entirely, and shortening the remainder.
With a good feeding at the same time, they will
throw up strong young shoots, full of vigour, which
will bear fine and well-coloured flowers. Of course,
a season of blooming will be lost by doing this, but
it will be amply compensated for in after years by a
healthy plant in place of a decrepit and unsightly
one. The list appended includes practically every
flowering tree and shrub <i>hardy</i> in this country, with
the proper time of pruning it. Those not specified
flower on the old wood.</p>

<p>When shrubs that by nature flower freely and are
rightly placed with regard to soil and position refuse to
bloom, root pruning will sometimes effect an alteration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abelia.</span>&mdash;This genus is barely hardy, and, in most
localities, is usually pruned sufficiently or too much
by frost. A moderate thinning of the shoots in
spring is sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acanthopanax.</span>&mdash;There are three species of this
genus hardy in this country, and of these <i>A. ricinifolium</i>
requires no pruning beyond the cutting away
of side-shoots to a single stem, as it attains the
dimensions of a tree in Japan, its native country.
<i>A. sessiliflorum</i> and <i>A. spinosum</i> are low-growing
shrubs, and require an occasional thinning out, which

to thoroughly ripen before winter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">CEANOTHUS AZUREUS, VAR. MARIE SIMON.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actinidia.</span>&mdash;A climbing genus, easily grown in
warm, sheltered localities. They require very little
pruning, but should be watched in spring when
growth has commenced, or the twining shoots will
get into a tangled and unsightly mass. Any growth
not required should be cut away in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Æsculus</span> (Horse-Chestnut).&mdash;The common representative
of this requires little or no pruning, but
the other species are benefited by a thinning out of
misplaced and useless branches in late summer to
allow light and air to the centre of the tree. This
is especially important to all the Æsculus in a young
state. <i>Æsculus parviflora</i> should have a good thinning
if the branches or suckers become at all thick,
cutting all growths not required clean away from the
base.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Akebia.</span>&mdash;"<i>Akebia quinata</i> has flowered here, on an
east wall, profusely for the last seventeen years, under
the following pruning treatment: Cover the space
allotted with the strongest shoots, and when new
growth pushes from the eyes or spurs in the spring,
do not regulate it, but summer-prune away all superfluous
growth before it gets entangled. It is from
'spurs' that the flowers are produced, and the more
these are kept clear, the more matured they become,
and flower correspondingly."&mdash;E. M. in <i>The Garden</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelanchier</span>.&mdash;These should be pruned after the
flowers are past, the removal of badly-placed and
weakly shoots being all that is required. If the
plants are becoming too large, they can be shortened
back at the same time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amorpha.</span>&mdash;If flowers are desired of <i>A. fruticosa</i>
it should be kept thinned out, and not be cut back;
but the flowers are not showy, and it is usually kept
cut down every winter for the sake of its foliage.
<i>A. canescens</i> should be cut down each spring to within
two or three eyes of the old wood, as it flowers best
on the young growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andromeda.</span>&mdash;The only recognised species of this
genus is <i>A. polifolia</i>, which requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aralia.</span>&mdash;These should be kept to a single stem
until they have attained a height of 6 to 8 feet, after
which they may be allowed to branch, or be still kept
to a single stem, as may be desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arbutus.</span>&mdash;An evergreen genus which requires no
pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristolochia.</span>&mdash;A genus of climbers which succeed
best if the shoots are not allowed to become too
thick. The weakest should be cut away in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artemisia.</span>&mdash;This genus is best known by its
common representative, the Southernwood, but this
and the other Artemisias should be cut down annually
in a young state. When older, an occasional thinning
out of the shoots in winter is sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baccharis.</span>&mdash;Of this, <i>B. halimifolia</i> flowers on the
young wood and should be cut back annually, while
<i>B. patagonica</i> should not be pruned at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberis.</span>&mdash;Properly the Berberis requires no
pruning, but the stronger-growing species, such as
<i>B. aristata</i>, <i>B. Lycium</i>, <i>B. virescens</i>, <i>B. vulgaris</i>, &amp;c.,
require an occasional thinning to keep them within
bounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berchemia.</span>&mdash;A climbing genus which requires no
pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bruckenthalia.</span>&mdash;A dwarf-growing Ericaceous
genus, the seed-pods of which should be removed as
soon as the flowers are past, or the plants will be
seriously weakened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bryanthus.</span>&mdash;This should be treated the same as
the last, which it somewhat resembles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buddleia.</span>&mdash;Of these, <i>B. variabilis</i>, <i>B. japonica</i>, and
<i>B. intermedia</i> flower on the young wood and require
cutting back every winter to within two or three eyes
of the old wood; <i>B. globosa</i> need not be pruned at
all, except in a young state to keep it bushy; and
<i>B. paniculata</i> only requires thinning out if it becomes
too thick, which is not a very common occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calluna</span> (the Ling).&mdash;This and its numerous
varieties should have the old flowers cut off as soon
as they are past, and any long or straggling growth
cut back at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calophaca.</span>&mdash;The solitary representative of this
genus is rather inclined to become straggly if growing
at all freely. When this is the case, the plant is
benefited by the cutting back of the longer shoots
in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calycanthus.</span>&mdash;These require an occasional thinning
of the branches, and any long shoots may be
shortened with advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camellia.</span>&mdash;These, which should be grown outdoors
much more than they are, should be cut down
if they get unhealthy or unshapely, which should be
done in April. Otherwise no pruning is required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caragana.</span>&mdash;Cut away all the straggling or misplaced
branches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carmichælia.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassandra.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Calluna</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassinia.</span>&mdash;These are grown more for their foliage
than for their flowers, and should be cut down in the
winter or early spring. This can be done annually
or biennially according to whether the plants are
growing strongly or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassiope.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Calluna</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catalpa.</span>&mdash;This genus contains some of our
handsomest flowering trees, all of which require
careful pruning after the flowers are past, thinning
out the weakly wood, and shortening any long
branches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceanothus.</span>&mdash;Of these, <i>C. americanus</i>, <i>C. azureus</i>,
<i>C. integerrimus</i>, and the garden hybrids, such as
"Gloire de Versailles," "Marie Simon," "Ceres,"
&amp;c., flower on the young wood, and should be cut
back in spring, allowing only sufficient shoots to
remain to form a well-balanced plant, and shortening
them back to within two or three eyes of the old
wood. The remaining species flower on the old
wood, and merely require a shortening back of the
stronger shoots and a thinning out of the weakly
ones after the flowers are past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Celastrus.</span>&mdash;A climbing genus of strong and
vigorous habit with showy fruits. They only require
sufficient pruning in winter to keep them within
bounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cercis.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning, except such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
may be necessary to make well-shaped plants, which
should be done after flowering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chimonanthus.</span>&mdash;The shoots of this should be
shortened back after flowering, and if on a wall they
should be spurred in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chionanthus.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Cercis</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Choisya ternata.</span>&mdash;This only needs thinning after
the flowers are over and old wood removed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cistus.</span>&mdash;Those which are hardy of this genus
should be cut back each spring while in a young
state, but when they have attained a flowering size no
pruning is required. The cutting back of young
plants induces a bushy habit, and also keeps
them from weakening themselves by blooming and
seeding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clematis.</span>&mdash;The garden forms of this genus are
divided into two sections, of which <i>C. Jackmani</i>,
<i>C. lanuginosa</i>, <i>C. Viticella</i>, and <i>C. aromatica (C. cærulea
odorata)</i> are the types of those which flower on the
young wood, and which require cutting back close
to the old wood in the winter; while <i>C. florida</i>,
<i>C. patens</i>, and <i>C. montana</i> are the types of those
which flower on the ripened wood of the previous
year, and merely require a thinning out of weakly or
unnecessary growth. Of species other than those
mentioned above, <i>C. Flammula</i>, <i>C. paniculata</i>, and
<i>C. Vitalba</i> flower on the young wood; and the remaining
species are either herbaceous or flower on
the old wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clerodendron trichotomum.</span>&mdash;Thin in spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clethra.</span>&mdash;These practically require no pruning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
but long shoots may be shortened and weakly ones
cut away with advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colutea.</span>&mdash;These make better plants and flower
later if they are cut back every winter. <i>C. istria</i> (a
rare species) should not be cut down if flowers are
desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornus.</span>&mdash;The strong-growing shrubby Cornus,
such as <i>C. alba</i>, <i>C. Amomum</i>, <i>C. Baileyi</i>, <i>C. pubescens</i>,
and <i>C. stolonifera</i> require an annual thinning out, and
those with brightly-coloured stems should be cut
down every spring for their effect during the following
winter. The remaining Cornus require little or
no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotoneaster.</span>&mdash;The large-growing species should
be pruned in late summer, but only sufficiently to
keep them within bounds; <i>C. Simonsii</i> requires cutting
down annually while young to make it bushy,
and the dwarf-growing kinds are best left alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratægus.</span>&mdash;Keep the heads well thinned out to
allow light and air to the centre of the tree. This
should be done in late summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cytisus.</span>&mdash;These require very little pruning, with
the exception of <i>C. nigricans</i> and <i>C. capitatus</i>, which
flower on the young wood, and should be cut back
annually. The other species and varieties make
better plants if they are cut down each year while in
a small state, but they should be left alone when
they have attained flowering size.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dab&oelig;cia</span> (the Irish Heath).&mdash;Cut away all old
flower stems in early winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daphne.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Desmodium.</span>&mdash;These flower on the young wood,
and should be cut nearly to the ground-line every
spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deutzia.</span>&mdash;The old wood should be kept cut out of
these, but no shortening of young shoots should be
attempted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elæagnus.</span>&mdash;These require an annual overhauling
to keep them in good condition. This should be
done in late summer, when the plants should be well
thinned out, and all useless growth cut clean away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Erica.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Calluna</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escallonia.</span>&mdash;These are usually cut back by frost;
but if they escape, <i>E. rubra</i> and <i>E. punctata</i> should
have their long growths shortened back in spring,
while the other hardy species need not be touched.
<i>E. macrantha</i> simply needs thinning. All the smaller
growths in the centre should be removed. <i>E. philippiana</i>
does not like hard cutting back, but the old
stumps must be cut out to make room for flowering
wood.</p>

<p class="caption">PEARL BUSH (Exochorda grandiflora) SHOWING ITS
NATURAL BEAUTY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exochorda.</span>&mdash;These usually require no pruning,
but if the plants are getting too large or unshapely,
they should be cut back immediately after flowering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fatsia</span> (<i>Aralia Sieboldii</i>).&mdash;This is usually cut by
frost, but it stands a cutting back in spring, when
new growth is soon made which will flower late in
the following autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fothergilla.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Garrya elliptica.</span>&mdash;This always flowers on the
previous year's wood. Need only be thinned to
ripen the new growth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Genista.</span>&mdash;<i>G. tinctoria</i> flowers on the young wood,
and should be cut back every spring. The other
species of Genista should not be pruned, except to
keep them in shape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halesia.</span>&mdash;These are small trees or large shrubs,
and should not be shortened back, but are improved
if the growths are kept thinned out, which should be
done after the flowers are past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halimodendron.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hamamelis.</span>&mdash;Thin out regularly, as they are very
apt to get thick and make weakly growths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedysarum multijugum.</span>&mdash;This flowers on the
young wood, and should be cut back lightly
each spring. The growths can also be pegged
down to improve the plant, which is apt to get
straggling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helianthemum.</span>&mdash;Cut away all dead flowers and
seed-pods after blooming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hibiscus.</span>&mdash;Thin out in winter, but only shorten
the longest shoots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jamesia.</span>&mdash;This should be treated as the preceding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jasminum.</span>&mdash;<i>J. fruticans</i> and <i>J. humile</i> are shrubs
which should be thinned regularly; and <i>J. nudiflorum</i>
and <i>J. officinale</i> are climbers, which should be spurred
in after flowering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kalmia.</span>&mdash;Remove seed-pods as soon as the
flowers are past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kerria.</span>&mdash;Cut away the old wood to encourage
the young growths, which yield the best flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laburnum.</span>&mdash;These should be thinned after
flowering, cutting away the old or weakly wood,
and shortening any long or straggling shoots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lavandula.</span>&mdash;Cut away all flower-spikes after
they are past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ledum.</span>&mdash;Remove seed-pods after flowering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lespedeza.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Desmodium</span>, which it much
resembles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leucothoë.</span>&mdash;<i>L. axillaris</i> and <i>L. Catesbæi</i> flower
much better if the old growths are removed and
strong young shoots encouraged. The rest of the
genus require no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leycesteria.</span>&mdash;Thin out old growths every spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ligustrum.</span>&mdash;<i>L. ovalifolium</i> and its golden variety
are all the better for being cut down each winter
while in a young state. The remainder merely
require an occasional thinning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Liriodendron.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lonicera.</span>&mdash;The shrubby Loniceras are nearly
all inclined to become very thick and full of weakly
shoots if not well looked after. A thinning out
should take place after flowering is past. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
climbing Honeysuckles should only be pruned sufficiently
to keep them within bounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lycium.</span>&mdash;These should be served the same as the
shrubby Loniceras, but the operation should be performed
in autumn or winter, as they flower practically
all the summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lyonia.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnolia.</span>&mdash;Generally speaking, the Magnolias
should not be pruned, but cut away useless or
decaying wood. Every wound, however small, on
a Magnolia should be tarred over immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Microglossa.</span>&mdash;The solitary shrubby representative
of this is <i>M. albescens</i>, which should be cut down
in winter, as it flowers best on the young wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myrica.</span>&mdash;An occasional thinning is sufficient for
this genus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myricaria.</span>&mdash;Flowering on the young wood; this
should be cut back every spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neillia.</span>&mdash;Thin out every year after flowering is
past, cutting back the old wood to strong young shoots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neviusia.</span>&mdash;This requires the same pruning as
Neillia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notospartium.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nuttallia.</span>&mdash;The single species of this flowers in
February, and is improved by a good thinning out of
the old wood when blooming is past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olearia.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ononis.</span>&mdash;<i>O. rotundifolia</i> should be cut down every
winter, as it flowers on the young wood. The remaining
species flower on the older wood, and need
not be touched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Osmanthus.</span>&mdash;These should not be pruned unless
a particular shape is desired, when the plants may be
clipped with a pair of shears in spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxycoccus.</span>&mdash;This is a small creeping genus allied
to Vaccinium, and requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxydendron.</span>&mdash;Remove seed-pods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paliurus.</span>&mdash;This attains the dimensions of a small
tree, and should be kept trimmed up for that
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parrotia.</span>&mdash;Thin out in spring after the flowers
are past.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paulownia.</span>&mdash;Keep to a single stem to a height of
about 8 feet, and then allow it to branch. If used
for sub-tropical bedding, it should be cut down to the
ground every winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peraphyllum.</span>&mdash;The solitary hardy species of this
should not be pruned or disturbed in any way if it
can be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Periploca.</span>&mdash;A climbing genus which should be
thinned out in winter, and only shortened back if
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pernettya.</span>&mdash;These should not be pruned at any
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphus.</span>&mdash;These should be thinned after
flowering, and the old wood cut back to strong
young shoots. This is especially important with
<i>P. microphyllus</i>, <i>P. coronarius</i>, and <i>P. Lemoinei</i> and its
varieties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phillyræa decora</span> (<i>Vilmoriniana</i>).&mdash;This well-known
shrub needs no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Photinia.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pieris.</span>&mdash;Remove seed-pods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potentilla.</span>&mdash;Thin out after flowering, and shorten
any old wood back to strong young breaks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prunus.</span>&mdash;When young, all the members of this
genus that are grafted or budded are improved by
being cut back each spring until they have attained
a fair size and shape. More especially is this the
case with the Almonds, double-flowered Peaches, and
the various flowering Cherries. When older, they
need only be thinned and the flowering Plums and
Cherries kept spurred in, but not too hard. <i>Prunus
japonica</i>, <i>P. nana</i>, and <i>P. triloba</i> should be cut down
to strong young breaks after flowering, the resulting
wood bearing better flowers than the old wood. If
any of these three latter are grown on a wall they
should be spurred back hard after blooming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptelea.</span>&mdash;When young, trim these to form small
trees, and do not allow them to develop into ungainly
bushes. When older, they require an occasional
thinning. <i>P. trifoliata var. aurea</i>, a golden form
which is not grown so much as it deserves to be,
should be cut back annually or biennially, the young
wood being better coloured and bearing larger leaves
than the old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pyrus.</span>&mdash;The wild Pears should be spurred in the
same manner as adopted for fruiting Pears, though
not quite so hard. The wild Crab-apples, such as
<i>P. baccata</i>, <i>P. floribunda</i>, <i>P. spectabilis</i>, &amp;c., should be
cut back every spring until they have formed well-balanced
heads. Afterwards an annual thinning and
a shortening of the longest shoots after flowering is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
sufficient. The remaining sections of Pyrus merely
require an occasional thinning. <i>P. japonica</i> should
be kept spurred in, whether growing on a wall or in
the open, and in the latter case should not be allowed
to become a mass of weakly shoots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhamnus.</span>&mdash;These should be thinned out if becoming
too thick, but, as a rule, they require very
little pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhododendron</span> (including <span class="smcap">Azalea</span>).&mdash;Remove all
seed-pods immediately the flowers are over, and any
plants that are in a sickly condition should be cut
down at the same time. By doing this a season or
two of flower is lost, but it is practically the only
means of bringing a weakly plant back to health
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhodotypus.</span>&mdash;Cut away old wood, and encourage
the strongest of the young growths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhus.</span>&mdash;Keep these well thinned out, and destroy
all suckers that appear, unless wanted for stocks.
Gloves should always be worn when handling any
of the Rhus, as the sap of <i>all</i> is poisonous to a certain
extent. <i>R. Toxicodendron</i> is <i>very poisonous</i>. This should
never be forgotten. If used for sub-tropical gardens
cut down to within two eyes of the base. Select the
strongest eye and rub the other off. Always use
gloves in handling this shrub. It should never be
planted where children have access to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ribes.</span>&mdash;All the Ribes are improved by being cut
down annually while in a young state, but when
older, a yearly thinning out of the old wood is
sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robinia.</span>&mdash;This is a genus that requires very little
pruning when the members of it have attained a
fair size, an occasional thinning being all that is
necessary. In a young state they require well
staking, and the longest shoots should be shortened
back, as many of them are top-heavy when young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span>&mdash;Although the various garden Roses come
under this heading, yet they are a class apart, and
are better dealt with by specialists. The species
of Rosa do not require any shortening of their
shoots, which should always be left at full length,
but all of them should have an annual thinning out
of the old wood, either cutting it right away or
back to a young shoot. Some of the species are
very prone to throw up suckers from underground
sometimes to a considerable distance from the plant,
and these should always be dug out and got rid of;
merely cutting them off only producing two evils in
the place of one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubus.</span>&mdash;This genus includes the Blackberry and
Raspberry, and in a modified form the treatment
accorded to them for fruiting is the best to employ
with the ornamental Rubi, that is, all old wood that
has flowered should be cut away and strong young
canes encouraged. But while in the cultivation of
the Raspberry only a few young canes are allowed
to grow, in the ornamental species practically every
young growth should be utilised. The double-flowered
Rubi should have some of the old wood
left, as they do not make so much young growth
as the single ones do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santolina.</span>&mdash;This is a dwarf-growing genus, the
old flower-heads of which should be cut away as
soon as they are past, and any long or straggling
growths cut back at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sambucus.</span>&mdash;The elders require very little pruning
as a rule, but the various cut-leaved, golden, or
variegated forms are improved by being cut back
annually. This will prevent them flowering, but
as good foliage is required the loss of the bloom
is a matter of little consequence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skimmia.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smilax.</span>&mdash;The hardy species of this genus do not
require any pruning if they have room to ramble.
If space is restricted, thin out and shorten in autumn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophora.</span>&mdash;These should be kept thinned when
they have attained flowering size; in a young state
they should be kept to a single stem and induced
to form well-shaped trees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spartium.</span>&mdash;This should be cut back in a small
state, but when older it requires no pruning
whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spiræa.</span>&mdash;Though all the Spiræas will flower on
the old wood, the following are better for being cut
back in winter to form young flowering shoots,
viz., <i>S. betulifolia</i>, <i>S. Douglasi</i>, <i>S. Foxii</i>, <i>S. japonica</i>,
<i>S. Margaritæ</i>, <i>S. salicifolia</i>, <i>S. semperflorens</i>, <i>S. tomentosa</i>,
and many of their varieties and hybrids. The
remaining Spiræas should be kept thinned out, and
if any are making strong young breaks from the
lower part of the plant they can be cut back to
them after flowering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stachyurus.</span>&mdash;This should be thinned out after
flowering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staphylea.</span>&mdash;<i>S. pinnata</i> should be kept thinned in
late summer; <i>S. colchica</i> and <i>S. Coulombieri</i> require
very little pruning, but if too tall or unshapely
should be cut back immediately after flowering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suæda.</span>&mdash;Cut back occasionally to keep it from

<p><span class="smcap">Symphoricarpus.</span>&mdash;Keep these well thinned out,
which should be done in late summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Syringa</span> (Lilac).&mdash;these should be kept free of
suckers, especially the finer-named kinds, which are
usually worked on stocks of the Common Lilac.
In addition, disbudding may be practised with advantage
in the spring, removing the majority of the
blind shoots and any flowering or leading shoots that
are misplaced or not required. This should be done
twice or thrice at intervals of ten days or a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tamarix.</span>&mdash;Cut back in a young state, but when
older they should not be pruned at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vaccinium.</span>&mdash;The removal of any old or rough
wood is sufficient for these.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Viburnum.</span>&mdash;All the Viburnums grow thickly, and
require an annual thinning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vitis.</span>&mdash;The methods practised in growing Vines
for fruit suit the ornamental species as well. If
space is restricted they should be grown on the
spur system, and if there is plenty of room then
the extension system may be employed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wistaria.</span>&mdash;These should be kept spurred in,
with the exception of the leading shoots, which
merely require a shortening in early spring according
to the strength of the plant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Xanthoceras.</span>&mdash;Requires no pruning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zenobia.</span>&mdash;These require no pruning as a rule,
but occasionally a hard cutting back will induce
healthy growth in place of a weakly one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thinning.</span>&mdash;It will be gathered from these notes
that thinning out only is needful in many cases.
If judicious thinning were more practised English
gardens would be more beautiful. It promotes
internal growth and a wealth of flowers.</p>

<p>Pruning is frequently carelessly and ignorantly
done, and this applies especially to forest trees.
There are certain tools that may be used for the
purpose. Under ordinary circumstances only a few
are necessary, and these should always be of the best
quality, sharp, clean, and always kept ready for use.
Take the pruning knife for example. If this is not
sharp it is impossible to make the necessary <i>clean</i>
cut. The surface will be jagged and rough, and
probably promote disease. Some prefer <i>secateurs</i>,
and while admitting their value for pruning purposes,
a good sharp knife is preferable; it is not
so heavy, and does not tire the hand. There are
several of these implements in the market, but the
best that has come under my notice is the "improved
double cutting"; it is easy to work and cuts clean.
For standard trees use the "Standard Tree Pruner."</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">PROPAGATION OF HARDY TREES
AND SHRUBS</h3>


<p>If we were to take many books about trees and
shrubs or general gardening as a guide, one might
be led to think that only one way of increasing a
tree or shrub existed, and that by grafting; but, as
we have pointed out elsewhere, it is a mischievous
practice when indiscriminately applied. It is <i>not</i> contended
by this that grafting and budding are utterly
needless, as in many instances these methods may
be rightly adopted, but the four natural ways of
increase are by layers, seeds, suckers, and cuttings.
Many trees and shrubs are much better when grafted
upon other stocks.</p>

<p>Of these, practise seed-raising whenever possible;
but if seeds cannot be procured, then adopt other
ways, and the man is wise who tries to keep a plant
on its own roots. Neither budding nor grafting
should be resorted to, unless other means fail absolutely.
When standard trees cannot be got true
from seed, budding or grafting must be practised,
and the evils of these methods of propagation are
not so pronounced in such cases as with dwarf
plants. With the former, suckers, or growths from
the stock, are easily seen as soon as they appear, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
with dwarf plants a perfect forest of suckers may
seriously weaken the plant before they are noticed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seeds.</span>&mdash;These can be sown at almost any time,
but the spring is the best, as those which germinate
quickly have time to form strong young plants before
the following winter. Some take two years to come
up, and should be left in the ground. This refers
more to seeds sown outdoors, and few hardy trees
and shrubs require heat to assist germination. When
sown in the open the beds should be made on a
fairly rich, moist piece of ground, protected from
cold winds, but fully exposed to the sun. After the
seeds are sown, cover them with light tiffany shading,
fir branches, or heather, but the first is best, as it
is easily removed to attend to the bed. Conifers
especially should be sown in beds, whether indoors
or outdoors, as pot-culture results in the roots taking
the shape of the pot, and never afterwards recovering
from their cramped condition. It must be remembered,
however, that varieties cannot be depended
upon to come true from seed, though by careful
selection for a few years many varieties will almost
reproduce the characteristics of the parents. Hybrids,
such as <i>Berberis stenophylla</i>, <i>Hypericum moserianum</i>,
and many others, also do not come true from
seed, so that cuttings, layers, or division of the old
plants must be the practice chosen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suckers.</span>&mdash;Plants which throw up suckers from
the base, or below the ground-line, are easily propagated
by detaching these suckers in winter with
a portion of root. They will grow away readily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and soon form good trees or shrubs as the case
may be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuttings.</span>&mdash;Nearly all the hardy shrubs, and a
small proportion of hardy trees also, can be propagated
by cuttings taken at certain times of the
year. Summer cuttings are taken during the last
two weeks of May and throughout June, the actual
time depending on the season, and consist of the
young shoots that have grown to a length of 3 to
6 inches. These should be pulled off with a "heel,"
and inserted in sandy soil in a close frame, with
brisk bottom heat. The cuttings should be taken on
a dull day, or early in the morning, and kept cool
and moist until they are in the frame. A cutting
that has flagged is useless, as it never revives. Deciduous
flowering shrubs are usually propagated by
summer cuttings, which generally root well in a
fortnight or less. Autumn cuttings are taken during
August and September, and are made from the
partially ripened growths of the current year, inserted
in sandy soil, in a close frame, without bottom
heat. Winter cuttings are made from thoroughly
ripened wood at any time between October and
March, and are laid in rather thickly in rows outdoors,
and only about an inch or less is left above
the soil. The majority of our best flowering shrubs
are easily increased in this way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Layers.</span>&mdash;Excellent trees and shrubs can be got
by layers, and they may be laid down at any time
of the year; they will be ready for removal in about
eighteen months or two years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Budding.</span>&mdash;This is done about August, and the
same rules apply to trees and shrubs as to Roses, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grafting.</span>&mdash;This takes place outdoors from March
to May, at the earlier time for deciduous trees and
shrubs, and later on for evergreens. The actual
time depends upon the season.</p>

<p>Where seed is not expressly mentioned below, it
must be understood that this is the natural, and in
many cases the best, way to propagate.</p>

<p>The following trees can only be raised from seed
to do any good afterwards, though a few of them
will throw up suckers, which can be taken off and
replanted: <i>Æsculus</i> (Chestnut), <i>Ailantus</i>, <i>Alnus</i>
(Alder), <i>Arbutus</i>, <i>Betula</i> (Birch), <i>Carpinus</i> (Hornbeam),
<i>Carya</i> (Hickory), <i>Castanea</i> (Sweet Chestnut), <i>Celtis</i>
(Nettle tree), <i>Fagus</i> (Beech), <i>Fraxinus</i> (Ash), <i>Gleditschia</i>
(Honey Locust), <i>Juglans</i> (Walnut), <i>Laburnum</i>,
<i>Liquidambar</i>, <i>Morus</i> (Mulberry), <i>Prunus</i>, <i>Pyrus</i>, <i>Quercus</i>
(Oak), <i>Sophora</i>, <i>Ulmus</i> (Elm), and <i>Zelkova</i>. The varieties
of any species of the above, and, in fact, of nearly
all hardy trees, must be budded or grafted on the
species they are forms of, but an exotic species
should never be worked on the native representative
of the genus&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> <i>Æsculus flava</i> should not be
budded on the Common Horse Chestnut, as the
latter is far too strong a stock for the smaller-growing
Æsculus.</p>

<p><i>Acer</i> (Maple) and <i>Tilia</i> (Lime or Linden) can be
raised from seeds or by layering, the Lime especially
being largely propagated from layers, which soon
form strong young trees. The varieties of Maple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
are best worked on stocks of the species they
belong to.</p>

<p><i>Cratægus</i> (Thorn), <i>Catalpa</i>, and <i>Robinia</i> (Locust
tree), can be raised from suckers or root-cuttings,
if seeds cannot be got. Any of their varieties are
usually budded or grafted on stocks of the parent
species.</p>

<p><i>Ilex</i> (Holly), <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>Populus</i> (Poplar), <i>Platanus</i>
(Plane), and <i>Salix</i> (Willow). The Holly is easily
raised from cuttings and layers, the second roots
readily when layered, and the latter three are propagated
in large quantities by winter cuttings. The
White Poplar (<i>Populus alba</i>) is an exception, as this
can only be increased by root-cuttings.</p>


<h3 class="gap2"><span class="smcap">Increasing Hardy Shrubs</span></h3>

<p>The best of our hardy flowering shrubs are grouped
under seven natural orders, and a knowledge of the
order to which a plant belongs is in most cases a guide
to its propagation, as the majority of the species contained
in an order are, as a rule, increased by the
same methods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberideæ.</span>&mdash;This contains <i>Akebia</i> and <i>Berberis</i>,
which are propagated by seeds, cuttings, or layers.
<i>Berberis stenophylla</i> and <i>B. Neuberti</i> do not come true
from seed, so that one or both of the other methods
mentioned above must be adopted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leguminosæ.</span>&mdash;In this order such genera as
<i>Cytisus</i> (Broom), <i>Genista</i> (Rock Broom), <i>Spartium</i>
(Spanish Broom), <i>Ononis</i>, <i>Indigofera</i>, <i>Colutea</i> (Bladder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Senna), <i>Caragana</i> (Siberian Pea tree), and <i>Cercis</i> (Judas
tree) should be raised from seed, which is the quickest
and best method of propagation. Cuttings of certain
forms of <i>Cytisus</i> and <i>Genista</i> will root readily, but
the plants will sometimes die off just as they have
attained flowering size. <i>Ulex</i> (Furze, Whin, or Gorse)
is propagated by seeds or cuttings, and <i>Wistarias</i> by
seeds or by layering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosaceæ.</span>&mdash;This includes <i>Prunus</i>, the shrubby
forms of which can, in the majority of cases, be
increased by cuttings or layers; <i>Spiræa</i> and <i>Kerria</i>
(Jews' Mallow), cuttings of which root readily at
almost any time of the year; <i>Exochorda</i> (Pearl Bush),
must be raised from seed to do any good; <i>Rubus</i>
(Brambles), some of which can be propagated by
suckers, and the remainder by pegging the points
of the shoots down to form young plants; <i>Rosa</i>
(Rose), the species of which should be increased by
seeds, cuttings, or layers, though seeds will not
always come true, as Roses become hybridised very
readily; and <i>Cotoneaster</i>, which are increased by
seeds, cuttings, or layers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxifrageæ.</span>&mdash;In this order <i>Hydrangea</i>, <i>Deutzia</i>,
<i>Philadelphus</i> (Mock Orange), <i>Escallonia</i>, and <i>Ribes</i>
(Flowering Currant) are included. All are easily
propagated by cuttings taken in almost any season
of the year. With the exception of Hydrangea,
which should be struck under glass, all the members
of this order root readily outdoors in the
winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caprifoliaceæ.</span>&mdash;This order contains such genera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
as <i>Sambucus</i> (Elder), <i>Viburnum</i>, <i>Lonicera</i> (Honeysuckle),
<i>Symphoricarpus</i> (Snowberry tree), <i>Abelia</i>,
<i>Leycesteria</i>, and <i>Diervilla</i> (Weigela). All are easily propagated
by cuttings or by layering. The cuttings can
be taken at almost any time of the year, and root
quickly, the young plants attaining a good size by
the end of the second year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ericaceæ.</span>&mdash;This order includes all the so-called
American plants, such as <i>Pernettya</i>, <i>Gaultheria</i>, <i>Leucothoë</i>,
<i>Andromeda</i>, <i>Pieris</i>, <i>Zenobia</i>, <i>Erica</i> (Heath),
<i>Calluna</i> (Common Heather, Ling), <i>Kalmia</i>, <i>Ledum</i>,
<i>Clethra</i>, and <i>Rhododendron</i> (including <i>Azalea</i>). These
can all be increased by seeds, layering, and, in
addition, the first two by division of the old plants.
<i>Erica</i> and <i>Calluna</i> can also be increased by cuttings.
Seedlings, of course, make the best plants, but layering
is a quicker method, and, in the case of some
of the smaller Ericaceæ, one of the easiest. All the
Rhododendrons will not root from cuttings, though
some of the small-flowered ones strike easily, but
practically all may be increased from layers. A few
of the showy garden forms cannot be raised from
layers, and have to be grafted on stocks of the
common <i>R. ponticum</i> or <i>R. catawbiense</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oleaceæ.</span>&mdash;This includes both deciduous flowering
shrubs and ornamental evergreens, such as <i>Syringa</i>
(Lilac), <i>Chionanthus</i> (Fringe tree), <i>Jasminum</i> (Jasmine),
<i>Forsythia</i>, <i>Ligustrum</i> (Privet), <i>Phillyræa (P. decora (vilmoriniana)</i>
is so easily raised from seeds or cuttings
that it is foolish to graft it on the common privet), and
<i>Osmanthus</i> being represented. The first two are best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
propagated by seeds or layers, though the named
garden Lilac is usually grafted on stocks of the
common <i>S. vulgaris</i>, a silly practice. It is a pitiful
business keeping down suckers from grafted plants.
Ask for Lilacs on their own roots, and much vexation
will be saved. A garden should be a place of
rest and pleasure, not a hunting-ground for suckers.
The other genera are readily raised by cuttings taken
at almost any time of the year, or by layering.</p>

<p>Although the above orders include a considerable
number of our best shrubs, several plants must be
specially mentioned. The Clematis is increased by
seeds, cuttings, or layers in the case of the species,
but unfortunately the garden forms are usually
grafted on <i>C. Viticella</i> or <i>C. Flammula</i>, whereas many
can be propagated by cuttings, and practically all
will root when layered.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">TULIP TREE AT RANELAGH (Winter).</p>

<p>In the absence of seeds the following genera must
be propagated by layers, viz., <i>Aucuba</i>, <i>Chimonanthus</i>
(Winter Sweet), <i>Halesia</i> (Snowdrop tree), <i>Hamamelis</i>
(Witch Hazel), <i>Hippophaë</i> (Sea Buckthorn), and
<i>Myrica</i> (Candleberry Myrtle). Cuttings of the first
will root readily enough, but never seem to succeed
afterwards. The female form of <i>Hippophaë</i> is best
raised from layers, as seedlings usually give a
large percentage of male plants. <i>Aralia</i> and <i>Rhus</i>
(Sumach) are increased by seeds or root-cuttings;
<i>Buddleia japonica</i> is best raised from seeds, and the
other Buddleias from cuttings; and practically all
other hardy shrubs that have not been specially
mentioned are easily propagated by seeds, cuttings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
or layers, and the majority of them by all three
methods.</p>

<p>If it is impossible to increase a tree or shrub by
any other means than by the three methods mentioned,
then resort to budding or grafting.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">A WINTER GARDEN OF TREES AND SHRUBS</h3>


<p>The budding spring, the ripening summer, the outpoured
riches of harvest, appeal to all, physically
if not spiritually. But to hundreds of people a
winter landscape is dreary beyond expression. They
never dream of going into a garden during the dark
months; to them its silent lessons are but a dead-letter,
nor would they ever wake to the beauty of
bare boughs nor pause to note the strange glow of
withered Fern fronds in the grey gloom of a foggy
day. We are not wholly free from blame in this
matter in so far as our gardens are concerned, for
spring and summer and autumn all have their share
in the garden plan, while winter, too often, stands
apart uncared for and unclothed. Yet how much
may be done by the right grouping of beautiful trees
and shrubs to make the winter garden harmonious
and inviting.</p>

<p>"You see, it takes a deal of insight to know
what's a-going to be," was a remark, half-apologetic,
half-regretful, often made by an old gardener of a
school now gone by, when matters horticultural
went somewhat athwart of his calculations. The
words recur to mind as containing a germ of truth
beyond the meaning of the speaker. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
well said with regard to deeper matters that foresight
must spring from insight, and it may be taken
also as a foundation principle of good gardening.
For just in proportion as we use our faculties of
insight and foresight will our gardens grow, more
or less, into a perfect expression of our sense of the
ever-changeful, never-ending beauty of Nature.</p>

<p>It must be no cursory glance given to get rid of
an unwelcome duty. We must look deep into the
meaning of things as they are&mdash;a meaning which
never lies wholly on the surface&mdash;before we can
forecast them as they are going to be, and such
insight rarely comes by intuition. The seeing eye
is given only to a few, though with some it is
but sleep-holden and needs no more than to be
awakened.</p>

<p>The things that are and the things that are to
be. Let us take the thought as company and try
to glean some of Nature's own lessons of fitness.
How instinctively we seek, for a winter ramble,
the shelter of the woodland copse, which is not far
distant from any English country habitation. The
broad grass drive is hoar with frosty rime in the
shadow of the bushes and crisp under foot. Under
the trees the ground on either side is carpeted
with Ivy. The lithe, trailing stems, wreathed with
their shining, taper-fingered leaves, so exquisitely
pencilled, are cushioned on the soft, feathery moss,
or twine in and out amongst the Hazel stocks, or
creep at will up the nearest tree trunk. One can
scarcely look at Ivy on a winter's day without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
thrill of admiration, especially this woodland sort,
for, mark it well, Nature never encourages the
coarse-leaved Ivy of common cultivation within her
domains. How perfect in its grace is this fine-leaved
Ivy, how utterly content with its surroundings,
how resolutely cheerful, be the circumstances of
weather or situation what they may! Clinging lowly
to the ground or mounting to the topmost branch
of some tall Pine, it is equally at home, and why
should we not agree with that good naturalist, Charles
Waterton, in his assertion that forest tree was never
injured by its clasping stems? An English plant
for our English climate, it may be used to make
beautiful an unsightly building, to clothe a decaying
tree stump, as bush or border or mantle, in
a hundred different ways, yet it is never out of
character, and never touches a jarring note.</p>

<p>Then those tall Hollies, see how dauntlessly they
stand up above the undergrowth of Hazel. How
living and warm, in their ruddy glow, are the clustering
berries in the glint of the fearless leaves. For
expedience sake, their lower branches have been
trimmed away, and greatly we gain by it, for otherwise
that lovely contrast of their ashen-grey stems
would be hidden from our eyes; but over yonder
a fine old Holly tree stands alone, which axe and
knife have left untouched, and how graceful is the
curven sweep of its feathering boughs. No foreign
evergreen can excel it for symmetry of form or
winter garniture of leaf and fruit. Life is astir, too,
in the brown twigs of the Hazel bushes. The infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
year is not more than a week or two old, yet already
the tasselled catkins are swinging in the lightest
rustle of the sighing wind, and begin to lift up their
tiers of small woolly cowls to set free the yellow
pollen-dust. And so we may go on our way, and,
at every turn, some rugged Yew, or clump of
red-stemmed Scotch Fir, or tapering Spruce with
hanging russet cones, will stay our steps, and if we
look and listen, they will tell us in their own way
the story of their perfect fitness for our homely
English landscape. Or, if we chance to be in one
of the chalky districts of the South Downs, we may
come upon Box, the ever young, as it was called of
yore, or Juniper, in its bloom of silver grey, as
precious as any, to add to the tale of our best native
evergreens.</p>

<p>Now it is to a wise choice of evergreens and to
their rightful placing that we must look for the
basis of our content in the winter garden. The
insight of our forefathers foresaw the solid comfort
of the rampart of Yew which was fostered of old
in many a manor-house garden. It caused them
to fence about their dwellings on north and east
with a belt of sturdy timber trees, to meet and ward
off in their pliant strength the roughest winter gales.
It planned the sheltered nut-walk and the pleached
alley and the cosy settle, carved out of the thick
Box bushes, on the grassy verge of the bowling-green.
They took of the materials at hand, and
many have since their day blessed the foresight
which planted, not only for themselves, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
for their children's children. That they were not
blind to the rare beauty of foreign trees many a
magnificent Cedar of Lebanon and massive Holm
Oak or deciduous tree&mdash;like the fine Tulip trees at
Mackery End, beloved of Charles Lamb&mdash;bear noble
testimony to this hour.</p>

<p>Nothing, perhaps, in the wide range of garden
beauty is more pictorial than an ancient Cedar,
dusky and glaucous, with cavernous shadows, holding
upright the smooth, pale-brown, rounded cones on
its flattened branches, or some grand Silver Fir
standing alone in its solemn symmetrical beauty, or
even, as may now and then be seen, though rarely,
some stately Araucaria, wind-sheltered, whose radiating
branches sweep down upon the greensward.
Others there are, no less pictorial perhaps, nor even
less exacting, for none can do without the shelter
of a good position, such as the Stone Pines, with
corrugated trunk and green spreading head; or
again, the graceful fragrant Cypress (<i>C. lawsoniana</i>)
of more recent date, with its slender pyramidal
growth and drooping feathery branches, taking on
at the close of winter the ruby-red of the catkins
which tell of the coming of the small, bloom-powdered
cones.</p>

<p>The desperate hurry, the incessant crowding out
of the times in which we live, give little encouragement
to the sentiment of planting for posterity, yet
some such planting is continually being done. This
much must be said, that the last fifty years have
seen the introduction of numberless fine trees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
shrubs, the fitness of which for our climate time
alone could test. During that period in England,
the Mammoth tree of the Yosemite Valley (<i>Sequoia
gigantea</i>) has been planted in its thousands, and
by irony of fate, the giant not seldom finds itself
cramped within the limits of a half-acre plot. But
leaving out the question of space, it is a tree
utterly unsuited to our northern climate, unless
under exceptional circumstances, as its scorched
and fretted branches on the windward side sufficiently
prove; while in itself it is not nearly so
grand or suggestive as its near-of-kin, the beautiful
Californian Redwood (<i>S. sempervirens</i>).</p>

<p>Ah! that burning question of space, how it comes
between us and our highest garden aspirations!
Have we not all seen the Deodar or the Araucaria
trying to exist in a narrow, twelve-foot forecourt, and
smiled, if we have not rather been ready to weep,
over the crass absurdity of its position? But such
mistakes are made every day. Let us think, then,
before we plant, of the things that are going to be,
and take prudent counsel with ourselves.</p>

<p>Our garden resources, nowadays, are beyond all
calculation greater than those of our forefathers,
and we rejoice and are glad because of it; but we
should let nothing oust from our affections the
hardy trees and shrubs, native and naturalised, that
are at home in our climate, beautiful in themselves
and invaluable in their fitness to give shelter to the
more fastidious immigrants from other latitudes.</p>

<p>Shelter, in fact, is as the keynote to the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
garden. Beauty is killed when leaves that should
be green and smiling are bruised and brown, when
boughs that should be perfect in grace and curve
are twisted and tortured. We may be very sure,
too, that such symptoms of discomfort in our
gardens will re-act in disquiet on ourselves, whereas
the mere sight of tree or bush standing firm in its
green bravery through storm and stress tends, it
may be unawares, to brace and uplift. Even the
familiar Laurel, good as it is when suitably placed,
and used not too freely, is constantly scathed and
disfigured in damp or low-lying localities. For the
same reason, it is doubtful whether Rhododendrons
should be planted within range of our windows.
Most of them, in severe weather, frightened before
they are hurt, put on a melancholy air and droop
of leaf which is apt to send a shiver through any
shrinking mortal whose vitality is already low
enough.</p>

<p>The bare boughs of winter, on the contrary, are
never depressing. They sleep, but it is not the
sleep of death; they rest, but while they are resting,
we feel that the mystery of life silently works out the
fulfilment of the promise of re-awakening. Meanwhile,
before the veil of leafage hides so much else
that is beautiful from our eyes, we see the things
that are, tree trunks in all their majesty of girth and
column and fencing bark, the net-work of budding
spray, each after its kind distinct, yet each in its
own form perfect. Even in mid-winter, the brown
gummy buds of the Horse Chestnuts begin to swell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
at the ends of the swaying boughs, and the Ash-buds,
as they make ready to burst their bonds, put
on a deeper hue.</p>

<p>The Beeches keep their silken green tight shut
within their scale-bound points, and will not let it
unfold an hour too soon; but look at the lovely
colouring, now silvern, now golden green, of the
Lichen-stains on the smooth grey bark. Contrast
it with the deeply-chiselled ribs of the Sweet Chestnut,
the rugged armour-plates of the Oak, the thin
white tissue of the dainty Silver Birch. It is this
diversity, these contrasts, which make up the charm
of winter, while the sombre green of Fir and
Yew intermingling with the leafless trees gives just
the touch of warmth and comfort which winter
lacks. If any of these bless our gardens with their
gracious presence, let us hesitate long before any
trivial inconvenience tempts us into doing away
with them. A single group of Silver Birches, one
spreading Beech, a clump of Scotch Fir, with a
stretch of grass beneath them, is more precious to
look out upon in the winter garden than all the
borders and rockeries that can be devised. Urge
as we may, however, for their own sake, the fitness
and constant delight of our native trees and evergreen
shrubs, we plead for them, no less, because
by their well-advised use our sheltered gardens may
become congenial abiding-places for the strangers
we may invite within our gates.</p>

<p>Do we profit as much as we might by the wealth
of garden beauty, in the way of trees and shrubs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
which for every intent and purpose lies within our
reach?</p>

<p>Take Magnolias, for example. They are not sub-tropical
trees, as we are apt to think, but fairly
hardy, and the Laurel Magnolia, so well known as
a beautiful covering for a south wall, is seldom
enough seen in standard form. Yet it is one of the
most stately of evergreen trees, and it would be hard
to find one more worthy of a good position, sheltered
from north and easterly winds. The whole outline
of the tree is noble, with its broad, shining, russet-backed
leaves, a delight to look upon in winter&mdash;nor
is it shy, when full-grown, of bearing in late summer
its scented ivory-white lily-cups. It is too much,
however, to expect the lovely-sculptured, crimson-flushed
cones, which in warmer climates than ours
open about November to disclose their hanging
scarlet seeds. Some of the deciduous Magnolias,
too, such as the fine Chinese Yulan (<i>M. conspicua</i>)
and the bushy white-flowered Japanese species (<i>M.
stellata</i>), are full of interest, even while lifeless. All
through the winter we may watch the gradual filling
out of the hairy, conical flower-bracts, until at length,
in very early spring, the impatient buds can contain
themselves no longer, and all too soon, sometimes,
push them off altogether that they may creep out
of their prison bands.</p>

<p>Every one has his private calendar, and reckons
the seasons by a computation of his own, but we
may safely say that four long months, if no more,
separate the falling of the leaf from its coming again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Perhaps we ought not to include Magnolias amongst
hibernal flowers, though the trees are often white
with blossom before the Larch is green; but the
list of shrubs which bloom, or are bright with
coloured fruit during those four months, would surprise
most people who think of winter only as the
dead season. The boughs of Sea Buckthorn are
loaded with orange berries. Clusters of scarlet peep
out of the fresh green of the Skimmia bushes and,
so long as the birds do not find them out, <i>Pernettya</i>
carries a crop of purple and crimson and pink fruit
more showy than the modest white flowers of summer.
When November days are growing dark, <i>Coronilla</i>,
in sheltered spots, puts forth its pale clustering yellow
flowers. Winter Jasmine, if the flowering branches
are not ruthlessly pruned away in autumn, covers
its long green shoots with golden stars. The evergreen
Clematis (<i>C. calycina</i>) is never happier than
when clinging to some terrace balustrade where it
may have a little kindly shelter, which it repays by
wreathing the stone-work with garlands of finely-cut
bronzed foliage, hung with creamy freckled bells.
More than one kind of hardy Heath, if grown in
spreading masses, will deck the garden with sheets
of colour the whole winter through.</p>

<p>The Chinese Honeysuckle (<i>L. Standishii</i>) arrays
itself in its fragile white flowers as early as January.
Witch Hazels hang their bare branches with twisted
petals of gold or amber or, sometimes (as in <i>Hamamelis
zuccariniana</i>), borrow the pale-green tint of the
under wing of a brimstone butterfly. Soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Christmas, Mezereon flushes into rosy purple, and
bushes of Winter-sweet (<i>Chimonanthus fragrans</i>), independent
of a wall (as few people know), will breathe
out its perfume from leafless branches studded over
with waxen-yellow flowers. It is strange how many
of these winter-blooming plants keep their leaves
well out of harm's way, brave as their flowers may
be. But so it is, and so we learn that if we would
gain their fullest winter beauty, we must group them
with evergreen shrubs as foil or background.</p>

<p>And what store there is of these to choose from,
not green only, but colour-tinged&mdash;<i>Berberis</i> of many
kinds, the shining ordered leaf-rows of <i>Azara</i>, the
purple tints of <i>Mahonia</i> and <i>Gaultheria</i>, the bronze of
<i>Andromeda</i> buds, the deep dull green of <i>Osmanthus</i>,
the wine red of <i>Leucothoë</i>, the pearl grey of <i>Atriplex</i>,
and a hundred more will respond to our beck and
call. Only we must choose with judgment, for
whether our lot is cast in north or south, in the
black east or soft caressing west, makes all the difference
to our choosing. Only be sure that more
important still than climate are the wind-breaks we
can plan, and the shelter we may contrive. Yet
when we are in doubt we can always come back
with satisfaction to the quick-growing hardiest shrubs
and find in them some fit setting for our garden
picture. The slender angled branches of green
Broom, the rigid spiny Furze, scented Rosemary, or
hoary Lavender&mdash;all will lend their varied tints and
attributes as we need them. And if a pool or stream
only gives us opportunity, what can surpass the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
winter colouring of osier twigs&mdash;golden and crimson
and olive, mirrored in still water or broken into a
thousand reflections by the ripple of a running brook?</p>

<p>Perhaps, amongst all the wealth of winter evergreen
shrubs the rank of those which show variegation
is too much exaggerated. Popular as they are,
the effect is not always good, unless more than
ordinary care is taken in their placing. Some few,
like the best golden and silver Hollies, are very
beautiful, though not all of these are improvements
upon the finest green forms. No variegated shrub,
probably, is more universally grown than the Aucuba,
and it has excellent points; it is hardy in constitution,
handsome in outline, and bold of leaf. By ill-luck,
as it happened, more than a hundred years ago,
the spotted variety was sent home first from Japan,
and became domiciled in English gardens and rooted
in English affections before the far more worthy
green species made its entry.</p>

<p>It is but a private opinion and not given as dogma
that it might possibly be a distinct gain to gardens,
large and small, if the spotted Aucuba were practically
banished and the true green-leaved forms&mdash;some
of which are generally beautiful when well set
with large coral berries&mdash;allowed to take its place.
The variegated Oleaster (<i>Elæagnus pungens</i>), a remarkably
fine shrub when taken by itself, sadly disturbs
the repose and dignity of the garden outlook in
winter, though doubtless positions might be found
in which it would harmonise with its surroundings.</p>

<p>We need only con over, mentally, all the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
familiar examples of shrub variegation to find, probably,
that we should do as well without a goodly
proportion of them, though we may frankly admit
some to be very handsome. The secret of our
discontent, possibly, lies in the fact that variegation
in plants that are normally green is not, in its
essence, a sign of health but of wasting sickness.
In any case, whatever our feelings may be on this
particular point, it is well worth while to weigh the
merits of each shrub, variegated or green, before
we plant it, not only individually, but in relation to
its neighbourhood to other garden associates, and
more especially with regard to its winter aspect.</p>

<p>Mr. Bean writes as follows about the winter
beauty of trees and shrubs: "Even in November
and December there are trees and shrubs that
brighten the garden with their coloured bark and
fruits. Although not abundant, the members of
this class are not used so extensively as they
might be.</p>

<p>"Among Willows, for instance, there are the
golden and red-barked varieties of <i>Salix vitellina</i>.
These, though scarcely ever seen, are capable, when
properly treated, of producing bright warm effects
that are especially charming from November to
February. When allowed to grow naturally this
Willow&mdash;known popularly as the Golden Osier&mdash;forms
a graceful tree of large size. Its twigs have a
golden or red tinge, according to the variety, but on
fully-grown trees these twigs are not large, and as it
is, of course, the bark of the preceding summer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
growth only that is coloured no very marked colour
effect is produced. To obtain a really bright patch
of colour it is necessary to plant these Willows in
goodly-sized groups and to prune them hard back
every spring. By treating them in this way a great
cluster of long, wand-like growths is made every
year, the bark over the whole of which becomes a
bright yellow or red as winter approaches. An
effective group is produced by mixing the red and
yellow-barked varieties.</p>

<p>"Another striking Willow is <i>Salix daphnoides</i>. The
young bark of this species is covered with a thick
glaucous or vivid blue-white 'bloom.' <i>S. acutifolia</i>
is similarly distinguished, though not quite so
markedly. Different from any of these Willows,
too, is the variety of <i>S. triandra</i>, with purplish-brown
bark. To bring out fully the ornamental qualities of
these Willows they should be treated as advised for
<i>Salix vitellina</i>. All these Willows are especially
charming near the edge of water. Not only are
their moisture-loving propensities satisfied, but their
beauty is doubled by reflection in the water.</p>

<p>"Somewhat similar to the Willows in the character
of their bark, but useful in being adapted for drier
situations, are the Cornels (<i>Cornus</i>). The best of the
genus in this connexion are <i>Cornus alba</i> and its variety
<i>sibirica</i>. They produce bark which for one or two
seasons remains a bright red during the time the
branches are leafless. A group of <i>Cornus alba</i>, with
<i>Chionodoxa Luciliæ</i> or Winter Aconite planted thickly
beneath, gives a very pleasing bit of colour early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the year. A yellow-barked form of <i>Cornus stolonifera</i>,
known as <i>flaviramea</i>, deserves mention.</p>

<p>"Several shrubs are notable for the particularly
bright green of their bark. The forms of <i>Kerria
japonica</i> and <i>Neillia</i> are very bright during the
winter on this account, but still more effective is
a near ally, <i>Stephanandra Tanakæ</i>, a comparatively
new shrub, also from Japan, but of little value in
any other respect. Finally, I may mention the
Rubuses with white stems. As in <i>Salix daphnoides</i>,
the bark is covered with the waxy secretion known
as 'bloom,' and of a blue-tinted white. Some six
or seven species of Rubus have this character.
Of those obtainable from nurseries, <i>R. biflorus</i>, a
Himalayan species often to be had from dealers
under the erroneous name of <i>Rubus leucodermis</i>, is
the best. Dr. A. Henry has introduced a Chinese
species, <i>Rubus lasiostylus</i>, which is even better than
<i>biflorus</i>; the bloom is more distinctly blue, and
the stems sturdier and more self-supporting. The
species is, however, an extremely rare one in cultivation.
It is scarcely necessary to repeat how
essential it is that these Brambles and Cornels
should be planted in bold groups.</p>

<p>"Among trees the most noteworthy as regards the
colour of their bark are the Birches. The beauty
of the Common White Birch has not been overlooked
by planters. A single specimen or a few grouped
together make a bright winter picture when associated
with evergreens. The Canoe Birch of North
America (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>) has a bark of an even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
purer white than our native species. The Yellow
Birch (<i>B. lutea</i>) shows warm orange-brown tints on
the more recently exposed surfaces of its bark. The
bark of the River Birch (<i>B. nigra</i>) is not brightly
coloured, being of a dull dark brown, but it gives the
tree a notably curious aspect owing to the way it
stands out from the trunk and branches in great
ragged-looking flakes.</p>

<h3 class="gap2 smcap">A Flower Garden in Winter</h3>

<p>"It is possible to make a new feature in gardens by
setting apart a piece of ground exclusively for the
cultivation of trees, shrubs, and bulbs&mdash;in short, any
plants that flower or are bright with fruit or bark
between, say, the beginning of November and the
end of February. One might term it 'an outdoor
winter garden.' For the purpose there would be
required a well-drained piece of ground, the soil of
which was fertile and open. The situation should
be fully exposed to the south and west, but guarded
well on the north and east sides by a thick belt of
evergreen trees and shrubs. The shelter would be
still more complete if the site sloped rather steeply to
the south-west. Such shelter would be welcome,
not only to the plants that grew there, but to those
who might visit and tend them. Some of the more
noteworthy trees and shrubs with ornamental barks
I have already mentioned. Plants that carry their
fruit into winter might be included, such as the
Hollies, especially the yellow-berried Holly; <i>Cra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>tægus
Crus-Galli</i> and <i>C. cordata</i>; <i>Cotoneaster rotundifolia</i>,
which is the best of all the Cotoneasters,
and frequently carries its bright-scarlet berries till
March; and <i>Hippophaë rhamnoides</i>, the Sea Buckthorn,
whose orange-coloured fruits are borne in
such profusion and retain their colour till past
Christmas if the frosts are not too severe. The
scarlet-fruited <i>Skimmia japonica</i> and its varieties are
very ornamental during the winter months, but of
these (as well as the Hippophaë) it is necessary to
grow male and female plants together. Groups of
variegated evergreens would not only help to give
shelter and warmth, but would also add to the
brightness of the garden. The best of them are the
golden and silver variegated Elæagnuses, the Hollies
of a similar character, and the best of the Aucubas,
of which there are now some very fine forms; the
female plants are also very ornamental as fruit-bearers.
<i>Pinus sylvestris aurea</i>, a variety of the
Scotch Pine that turns golden in winter but is
green at other seasons, and <i>Cupressus macrocarpa lutea</i>
are the two best Conifers of their class. Many of the
variegated Conifers lose most or all of their colour as
autumn and winter approach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;"><a id="image0020" name="image0020" href="images/illus0098.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0098th.jpg" width="236" height="159" alt="ULMUS ALATA." title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">ULMUS ALATA.</p>

<p>"With regard to the trees and shrubs that bear
flowers between November and February, the number
is not, of course, great; still, they constitute a
group that is larger, perhaps, than is generally supposed.
The following list, which comprises all that
I can call to mind, may be useful even to those who
would not intend to bring them together in one spot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Some country houses are only occupied during the
shooting and hunting seasons, and these winter-flowering
plants are of especial value in such
places. The tree or bush Ivies are very beautiful,
and may be had in great variety, such as yellow
berried, <i>palmata aurea</i>, <i>rhomboidea ovata</i>, and <i>amurensis</i>."</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS WITH BEAUTIFUL
CATKINS</h3>


<p>When thinking of trees and shrubs in early spring
we must remember those with beautiful catkins. Of
the earliest flowering hardy trees and shrubs the
majority are those with flowers borne in catkins.
Their appearance is one of the first evidences of
the approach of spring. It is to the catkin-bearing
group that the Poplars, Willows, Birches, and Alders
belong. These catkins are pendulous, cylindrical,
and often slender inflorescences, carrying flowers
of one sex only, which spring from the axils of
scaly bracts. Being mainly dependent upon the
wind for their fertilisation, they have none of the
varied or bright colours that are characteristic of
flowers fertilised by insect agency. Often, indeed,
sepals and petals are entirely absent. Still, many of
these catkin-bearers possess a charm and beauty of
their own, which, taken with the early, often inclement,
season when they appear, make the best of them
indispensable in gardens where early spring effects
are desired. As a rule it is the male or pollen-bearing
catkins that are most ornamental. They
are longer and more graceful than the seed-bearing
ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Poplars</h3>

<p>First among Poplars to bear its flowers, and
almost before winter is past, is the Aspen (<i>Populus
tremula</i>). This and its weeping variety bear their
catkins in February, but closely following it, and
perhaps more ornamental, is the American Aspen
(<i>P. tremuloides</i>). This species flowers early in March
near London in mild seasons, but later further north,
and when kept back by severe weather. The pendulous
variety of <i>P. tremuloides</i>&mdash;known commonly as
Parasol de St. Julien&mdash;is, at the flowering time,
probably the most beautiful and striking of all
catkin-bearing trees. This and also the type produce
long, slender catkins that sway gently in the
softest winds. The weeping variety, which has
branches that weep naturally low, looks well by
itself on a lawn. In all these Poplars the male
catkins are three inches to four inches long, chiefly
grey-brown in colour; the scale-like bracts, however,
are suffused with a reddish shade. The weeping
varieties of these two Aspens are frequently grafted
on the White Poplar, which is not a suitable stock.
The species to which the varieties severally belong
should be used for the purpose. It would be even
better if they could be got on their own roots by
means of layers or cuttings, and trained up to the
required height before allowing the weeping habit
to develop.</p>

<p>There are other Poplars that bear their catkins
freely, such as <i>P. alba</i>, <i>nigra</i>, and <i>balsamifera</i>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
being of loftier habit they do not show to the same
advantage as those of the Aspen group.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Hazels</h3>

<p>Between the middle and the end of February the
flowers on the catkins of the various species of
<i>Corylus</i> begin to expand. Early as that date is, the
catkins have, nevertheless, been in evidence since
the previous autumn; they were, in fact, formed
before the nuts fell. Being comparatively low and
shrubby the different varieties of the Hazel (<i>Corylus
Avellana</i>) show their catkins to best advantage, and
there are few among the catkin-bearers more charming.
It is not often that any but the coloured-leaved
varieties find a place in the garden proper, but either
in the orchard or in the woodland the soft yellow of
the Hazel catkins is one of the most pleasing notes
of earliest spring. The Tree Hazel (<i>Corylus Colurna</i>),
a fine and interesting tree, growing thirty feet or
more high, also bears its catkins in February.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Willows</h3>

<p>Of the almost innumerable species and varieties
of <i>Salix</i>, it is only a few that need be mentioned here
for their beauty when in flower. So far as I have
been able to judge, the most ornamental of the
Willows in catkin time is <i>Salix smithiana</i>, known also
as <i>S. mollissima</i>. This tree flowers about mid-March,
producing its shortish, thick male catkins in very
great abundance; the numerous exposed anthers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
give a soft but glowing yellow tone to the tree, and
entitle it to rank as one of the most ornamental
of early-flowering trees. The pendulous variety of
<i>Salix Capræa</i> is known as the Kilmarnock Willow.
Although of weeping habit it is somewhat stiff in
character; but towards the end of March and later
it is exceedingly pretty loaded with its grey catkins.
The flowers of the typical <i>S. Capræa</i> (the Goat
Willow) are commonly known in many country
places as Palm, and are used for decorating churches
on Palm Sunday. The slender, coloured twigs of
the Purple Willow (<i>Salix purpurea</i>) bear red or
purplish-tinted catkins in early April. <i>Salix stipularis</i>
may also be mentioned for its beauty when in flower.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Alders</h3>

<p>With the exception of a few species, such as <i>Alnus
nitida</i> and <i>A. maritima</i>, which flower in September
and October, all the Alders develop their blossoms
in February and March. The common Alder (<i>A.
glutinosa</i>) and its varieties are perhaps as ornamental
as any at that time. Like the Willows, they look
best and grow best in association with water. In
such a position an Alder at that time, leafless, but
laden with its slender, greenish-yellow catkins, is a
beautiful object, and characteristic, too, of our
English landscape. Other species possessing a
similar quiet beauty are <i>Alnus incana</i>, <i>A. viridis</i>, <i>A.
oregona</i>, and especially <i>A. cordifolia</i> with its green
and yellow catkins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Japanese Walnuts</h3>

<p><i>Juglans sieboldiana</i> and its close allies, <i>J. mandschurica</i>
and <i>J. cordiformis</i>, do not flower till May, but bear at
that time very remarkable male catkins. I have
measured them over one foot long, and hanging as
they do in goodly number from the branches, perfectly
straight and cylindrical, they have a very
striking appearance, although green. All three
species are alike in their catkins, but differ in the
shape of the nuts. They are noteworthy, too, for
the imposing character of their foliage. The leaves
are pinnate, and on young trees grown in good
soil are frequently three feet long. They certainly
deserve the notice of planters.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Garrya elliptica</h3>

<p>From all the catkin-bearers hitherto mentioned,
this differs in being evergreen. It is also far removed
from them in relationship, and is closely
allied to the Cornels. At the same time the catkins
in external characteristics are very similar. Not only
the catkins but the plants themselves are unisexual,
and, as is usual with the catkin-bearers, it is the
male that is most ornamental. These catkins are
from four inches to eight inches long, and I have heard
of (but not seen) them as much as one foot in length.
The time at which the flowers expand depends, as
with all the early catkin-bearers, on the mildness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the season. This year on a wall the catkins have
been in beauty ever since the first week of January.
They are very attractive in their grace and quiet
beauty. Chiefly of soft grey and green colours, the
bracts are, however, suffused with a warmer reddish
tint. In the neighbourhood of London Garrya
elliptica is quite hardy in ordinarily sheltered positions,
but does not flower so freely as against a
south wall. As it is of Californian origin this is not
surprising. This shrub resents disturbance at the
root, and in transplanting great care is necessary.</p>

<p>There are other species of Garrya in cultivation,
but they are more suitable to the south-western
counties than to the average climate of Britain.</p>

<p>To the catkin-bearing family belong several other
well-known trees, such as the Birches, Hornbeams,
and Sweet Chestnut; but flowering later in the
year their beauty is apt to pass without notice in
the great flush of bloom that comes in with April.
The beautifully fragrant Sweet Gale must not be
passed without mention. Its reddish brown catkins
are formed before autumn, and expand on the still
leafless twigs in spring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>



<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">AUTUMN COLOURS</h3>


<p>There is a mystery about the autumn colouring of
the foliage of our many beautiful hardy trees and
shrubs in this country, and we have never yet
ascertained with any degree of exactness the conditions
that produce the richest and brightest tints.
Probably the conditions most favourable generally
are provided by a good growing season&mdash;that is, a
warm, moist summer&mdash;followed by a dry, sunny
autumn. But it frequently happens after what one
would regard as favourable seasons, that species
which are usually quite trustworthy in this matter
fail to colour well. Probably one set of conditions
does not suit all trees and shrubs in this
respect. To produce the colouration of the leaf
just before it falls certain subtle chemical changes
in its composition take place. And to bring about
these changes certain conditions in regard to sunlight,
temperature, and moisture are necessary. But
in a climate such as that of Britain, where the
seasons are never alike two years together, we can
never hope to obtain the same regularity of autumnal
colouring that characterises the vegetation, for instance,
of the Eastern United States. Still, when
all is said, we possess in our gardens a large number
of trees and shrubs and climbers that are delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in their autumnal livery of crimson, purple, scarlet,
or gold. It is curious that every season we may
notice species not usually conspicuous for their
autumn tints beautifully coloured.</p>

<p>An over-vigorous, sappy growth, often the result
of a wet, warm autumn or too rich a soil, is certainly
detrimental to autumn colouring. <i>Rhus cotinoides</i>, an
American Sumach, worth growing for the beauty of
its colours in autumn, is one of the most unfailing
in this matter. This is perhaps one of the loveliest
of all autumn-tinted shrubs, and should be more
planted. But young plants, put out in well-trenched,
heavily-manured soil, will often fail to
colour at all till they get older and less vigorous.
The most beautifully coloured examples of this
Sumach that we have seen grow in rather light
sandy soil. We have frequently noticed, too, that
various species of Vine (<i>Vitis</i>) when starved in pots
will colour exquisitely, whilst others, planted out in
the ordinary way, completely fail. We believe,
therefore, when planting with a view to the production
of autumnal colour, any great enrichment of
the soil is neither necessary nor advisable, provided
it is of moderate quality to start with.</p>

<p>In the following notes, brief mention is made of
some of the best trees, shrubs, and climbers that
colour in autumn:&mdash;</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Trees</h3>

<p>First among these are the American Red Oaks.
Undoubtedly the best of these is a variety of <i>Quercus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
coccinea</i> known as <i>splendens</i> and <i>grayana</i>. This not
only turns to a fine scarlet crimson, but it retains its
foliage for some weeks after the colour has been
acquired&mdash;sometimes almost up to Christmas. Other
good Oaks, not so certain, however, as the preceding,
are <i>Quercus marylandica</i> (or <i>nigra</i>), <i>Q. heterophylla</i>,
<i>Q. imbricaria</i>, and <i>Q. palustris</i>, all of which turn red.
The Tupelo tree (<i>Nyssa sylvatica</i>) turns a fine burnished
bronzy red. A tree remarkable for the size
of its leaves, and especially for the rich golden yellow
they put on in autumn, is <i>Carya tomentosa</i>, but, like
most of the Hickories, it is scarcely known in gardens.
<i>Carya sulcata</i> is somewhat similar. The Common
Elm is usually very beautiful in the soft yellow tints
of its leaves in autumn, but another Elm of more
distinct aspect is <i>Ulmus pumila</i>, a low tree whose
small leaves are retained till late in the year, and
turn golden yellow before they fall. <i>Liquidambar
styraciflua</i> has long been valued for its fading foliage
of purple red, but not so well known is the lovely
yellow of the Fern-like foliage of the Honey Locust
(<i>Gleditschia triacanthos</i>). The Tulip tree (<i>Liriodendron</i>),
the Nettle trees (<i>Celtis</i>), the <i>Zelkowas</i>, and several of
the Birches turn yellow, one of the best of the
Birches being <i>Betula corylifolia</i>, which turns a rich
orange yellow.</p>

<p>Among commoner trees the yellow of the Horse
Chestnut, the lovely crimson of the Wild Cherry, the
golden shades of the Black and Lombardy Poplars,
add much to the beauty of every autumn. Several
of the Maples are noteworthy in this respect, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
especially the numerous varieties of Japanese Maples
(<i>Acer palmatum</i> and <i>A. japonicum</i>), these, as well as
the Mandshurian <i>Acer Ginnala</i>, turning to various
shades of red. The Common Sycamore and Norway
Maple change to yellow, but Schwedler's variety of
the latter becomes red. Other trees that deserve
mention are <i>Amelanchier canadensis</i>, whose foliage
changes to lovely crimson shades in autumn; <i>K&oelig;lreuteria
japonica</i>, soft yellow; <i>Pyrus torminalis</i>, bronzy
red; <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, pale gold; <i>Cladrastis tinctoria</i>,
yellow; <i>Parrotia persica</i> and <i>Hamamelis</i>, bronzy red
and yellow. The Common Beech is nearly always
beautiful, changing first to yellow, then to warm
brown tints. <i>Clerodendron trichotomum</i> is a small
growing tree that should have a place wherever
beautiful autumn foliage is desired. Among Conifers
the yellow-leaved variety (<i>aurea</i>) of the Scotch Pine
is remarkable in retaining its colour during the
winter months only, becoming green in spring and
summer. <i>Retinospora squarrosa</i> and <i>Cryptomeria elegans</i>
turn bronzy red in winter. The warm red-brown
tints of the deciduous Cypress are charming.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Shrubs</h3>

<p>The Sumachs (<i>Rhus</i>) furnish some of the most
striking of autumn-colouring shrubs; the best of
them, <i>R. cotinoides</i>, has been already described; other
fine species are <i>R. typhina</i>, <i>R. glabra</i> (with the cut-leaved
variety <i>laciniata</i>), and <i>R. Toxicodendron</i>, all of
which turn red. The Venetian Sumach, <i>R. Cotinus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
becomes yellow. <i>Berberis Thunbergi</i>, which dies off
a rich scarlet, is so beautiful in autumn that on some
estates it has been planted in great quantity, not
only for cover, but so that sportsmen may enjoy its
colour during the shooting season. <i>B. concinna</i> is
another charming autumn-coloured leaved shrub
of dwarf growth. <i>Gaultheria procumbens</i> (Partridge
Berry) is too valuable to pass unnoticed. In winter
its leaves are stained with crimson. The leaves of
<i>Cotoneaster horizontalis</i> turn from green to rich shades
of chocolate or crimson. The shrub is of spreading
growth. Its evergreen ally, <i>B. Aquifolium</i>, turns a
glowing red or purple after the first frosts. The
Ghent Azaleas almost always colour richly, either
deep glowing crimson, bronzy red, or gold; and of
other ericaceous plants the warm tints of <i>Pieris
mariana</i> and the rich crimson of the <i>Enkianthus</i>
should be mentioned. The taller American <i>Vacciniums</i>
(<i>corymbosum</i> and its various forms) are always
lovely. Our native Guelder Rose (<i>Viburnum Opulus</i>)
becomes crimson in autumn, whilst the Common
Hazel and <i>Rhamnus Frangula</i> often produce fine
effects in yellow. The feathery foliage of <i>Spiræa
Thunbergi</i> is singularly beautiful when it changes
from its natural pale green to crimson; and <i>S.
prunifolia fl. pl.</i> is perhaps more distinct than the
species, and two other Japanese shrubs (both, unfortunately,
very rare) are remarkable for their
autumnal beauty. These are <i>Disanthus cercidifolia</i>,
an ally of the Witch Hazels, lovely claret colour,
and <i>Viburnum alnifolium</i>, crimson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Other noteworthy shrubs are <i>Fothergilla alnifolia</i>,
rich red; <i>Euonymus alatus</i>, crimson; <i>Deutzia crenata</i>,
yellow; and <i>Pyrus arbutifolia</i>, red. The common
Brambles of our woods should not be passed over
without mention; they turn a rich glowing red, and
for their autumnal beauty alone may be used as
undergrowth in wilder parts of the garden and
woodland.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Climbers</h3>

<p>First among these, of course, is Veitch's Ampelopsis,
the finest of all deciduous climbers for walls,
being self-supporting and changing to crimson in
autumn. <i>Vitis Coignetiæ</i> is one of the noblest of all
Vines, and turns crimson also. Other Vines useful
in this respect are the Teinturier Vine, purple;
<i>V. Romaneti</i>, red; and the Virginian Creeper, especially
that variety known as <i>muralis</i> or <i>Engelmannii</i>,
which clings to walls or tree trunks without any
artificial support, and acquires beautiful red shades
in autumn. Among Honeysuckles, <i>Lonicera japonica
var. flexuosa</i> is noteworthy for the fine red purple of
its decaying leaves. Those of <i>Akebia quinata</i> change
colour in autumn and assume shades of brownish
purple, sometimes touched with maroon. Then
there is <i>Actinidia Kolomikta</i>, an Asiatic species with
showy yellow-coloured leaves in autumn. Of the
Ivies <i>Hedera Helix atropurpurea</i> is much the best. It
has medium-sized leaves which are rich green during
the growing season, but change in winter to purple
and maroon.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS WITH FINE FRUITS</h3>


<p>The most important of all the groups of trees and
shrubs, for their fruit, is the one comprising the
hardy species of the Rose order. This includes, of
course, besides the Roses, such trees and shrubs
as the Thorns, Crabs, and Cotoneasters. Among
the Thorns (Cratægus) are many very handsome
sorts giving variety in size and colour of the fruits.
It is unfortunate that many of them fall early and
get spoilt by birds. At the same time birds add so
greatly to the delight of the garden that we may well
overlook their depredations. By many, indeed, these
fruiting trees will be considered worth growing for
the encouragement they give to bird-life. It may be
well to remind planters that a considerable number
of these fruiting trees and shrubs bear male flowers
on one plant, female on another. People are often
at a loss to understand why their Sea Buckthorns or
Aucubas or Skimmias do not fruit, when the simple
reason is that the plants are all male (or pollen-bearing),
or that the female ones have no males to
fertilise them. As a general rule, if these shrubs
are grouped, one male to eight or ten females
is a proper proportion. As plants raised from
seeds come in about equal proportions of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
sexes, it is necessary to select the females and
keep just sufficient males to pollenise them, in order
that the full beauty of the species as a fruit-bearer
may be obtained. With Skimmias and Aucubas the
proper proportions can be obtained by means of
cuttings.</p>

<p>The following hardy trees and shrubs are the
most conspicuous for the beauty of their fruits:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arbutus Unedo.</span>&mdash;A native of Western Ireland,
has strawberry-like fruits of a bright-scarlet colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ailantus glandulosa</span>, a fine tree over 50 feet
high, is very beautiful when covered with its red and
yellow-winged fruits; there are male and female
plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aucubas</span>, grown at first for their ornamental
foliage merely, have latterly come into prominence
as fruit-bearers; the female plants bear clusters
of bright-red berries which remain long on the
branches and are very attractive in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberis.</span>&mdash;The fruits of the Berberries are
mostly covered with a plum-coloured bloom as in
<i>B. Aquifolium</i> and <i>B. Darwinii</i>, but none of them
is handsomer than our native <i>B. vulgaris</i> and its
varieties. These have pendent racemes of fruits,
varying in colour from the typical orange scarlet to
white, purple, and black. <i>B. Thunbergi</i> coral-red,
very beautiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratægus.</span>&mdash;The finest of all the Thorns is <i>C.
Pyracantha</i>, well named by the French "Buisson
ardent." This shrub or small tree is valuable as
a graceful evergreen, and when clothed (as it nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
always is in autumn) with its brilliant clusters of
orange-red haws, it is one of the most beautiful
objects in the garden. It is quite hardy in the
open, but bears fruits more abundantly when
planted against a wall. In that position also it
is more easily protected from birds, which soon
destroy the beauty of plants in the open. The
variety <i>Lælandi</i> is distinct from the type, but hardier,
and bears bright berries in abundance. The Cockspur
Thorn (<i>C. Crus-Galli</i>) has several varieties, all
producing pendent clusters of scarlet haws. The
varieties like <i>pyracanthifolia</i>, with narrow leaves and
flat-topped habit, are the best in this respect; they
retain the fruits well into the winter, and are not
eaten by birds so freely as many are. The haws of
<i>C. cordata</i>, the Washington Thorn, are small, but a
brilliant orange. <i>C. punctata</i>, <i>C. Azarolus</i>, and <i>C.
pinnatifida</i> have the largest haws of any, and they
are of a deep red, but fall early; the two first,
however, are variable, and forms with yellow and
other coloured haws belong to them. Those
of <i>C. macracantha</i> are bright red, and in favourable
years are so plentiful as to make the tree
wondrously beautiful. <i>C. coccinea</i> and <i>C. mollis</i> have
also red haws, larger than those of <i>C. macracantha</i>, but
they fall soon after they are ripe. The Common
Hawthorn is pretty, but more noteworthy is its
variety <i>aurea</i>, with bright-yellow haws. In <i>C.
oliveriana</i> they are black. The Tansy-leaved Thorn
(<i>C. tanacetifolia</i>) has large yellow fruits, not badly
flavoured, and with the fragrance of Apples. <i>C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
orientalis</i> has haws of a bright sealing-wax red, but
in its variety <i>sanguinea</i> they are of a deeper shade.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">BABYLONIAN WILLOW BY WATERSIDE (Kew).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotoneasters.</span>&mdash;Not enough use is made of
Cotoneasters in gardens. They grow well in almost
any soil, and are all marked by elegant or neat habit.
They are very pretty when in flower, but it is in
autumn, when laden with fruits, that they attain
their greatest beauty. One of the tallest of them is
<i>C. frigida</i>, and this bears a great abundance of rich
scarlet-red berries in flat clusters. In the nearly
allied <i>C. bacillaris</i> they are almost black. <i>C. rotundifolia</i>
is a dwarfer shrub, but the finest of all the
Cotoneasters for its fruit; it grows about 4 feet
high, and has small, very dark green, persistent
leaves; the fruits are about the size and shape of
the haws of the Common Hawthorn, and are brilliant
scarlet red; they are ripe in October, and
from then till March make one of the most beautiful
of winter pictures. In <i>C. buxifolia</i> the fruit is very
abundant, but the red colour is not so bright as in
the preceding. <i>C. horizontalis</i>, now getting to be a
well-known shrub, has very pretty, globose, bright-red
fruits, small but freely borne. <i>C. Simonsii</i>, of
medium height, has brilliant red berries, as has
<i>C. acuminata</i>, a near ally, but taller. The dwarfest
section of Cotoneaster, viz., <i>thymifolia</i>, <i>microphylla</i> and
its variety <i>glacialis</i> (or <i>congesta</i>), which are so useful
for rockeries, have all scarlet berries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Celastrus articulatus</span> is a vigorous climber
from Eastern Asia, remarkable for the great beauty
of its fruits, which are golden yellow within, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
when ripe split open and reveal the shining scarlet-coated
seeds. <i>C. scandens</i> has orange-coloured seeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coriaria japonica</span> is very beautiful in autumn,
when it succeeds as well as it does with Canon Ellacombe
at Bitton, the fruits being covered then
with the persistent petals which are of a lovely coral
red.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">WEEPING ASH; PALACE GARDENS, DALKEITH.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornus capitata</span> (<i>Benthamia fragifera</i>) only succeeds
to perfection in the south-western counties;
its strawberry-like red fruits are very handsome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coprosma acerosa</span> is a dwarf New Zealand shrub
suitable for the rockery; it has variously-shaded,
transparent, blue-green berries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elæagnus multiflora</span> (or <i>E. longipes</i>) is the most
ornamental in the genus with regard to its fruits.
They are remarkably abundant, orange-coloured, and
specked with reddish scales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Euonymus europæus</span>, our native "Spindle tree,"
is most beautiful in autumn, when, after a favourable
season, it is covered with its open red fruits revealing
the orange-coloured seeds within.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fraxinus mariesii</span> is one of Messrs. Veitch's introductions
from Japan, and is a dwarf tree, one of
the "Manna" Ashes; the thin keys are of a bronzy-red
colour and pretty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gleditschia triacanthos</span> is the "Honey Locust."
The pods are not brightly coloured, being at first
green, then brown, but they are long, thin, and
wavy, like crooked scimitars, and hanging in numbers
on the tree; have a very curious and (in this country)
uncommon aspect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedera</span> (Ivy).&mdash;Some of the "tree" forms of Ivy
produce berries freely; the most ornamental of them
are the red, yellow, and orange-coloured varieties of
<i>H. Helix arborescens</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hymenanthera crassifolia</span>, from New Zealand,
is a dense-growing, stiff-branched, dwarf shrub,
chiefly noteworthy for the white berries it bears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hypericums.</span>&mdash;<i>H. Androsæmum</i> and <i>H. elatum</i> produce
rather handsome clusters of black fruits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippophaë rhamnoides</span>, the Sea Buckthorn, is one
of the most brilliantly coloured of all berry-bearing
shrubs. It produces them in marvellous profusion,
and they are bright-orange coloured. Birds do not
molest the berries, and unless caught by severe frosts
(which turn them grey) they lighten the garden
wonderfully up to, and sometimes after, the New
Year. The necessity of growing both sexes of plants
has already been noted, but isolated females may be
artificially impregnated by shaking pollen over them
when in flower.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">WEEPING ASPEN IN FLOWER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ilex</span> (Holly).&mdash;The berries of the Holly are so
well known that we need only mention the yellow-berried
one (<i>fructu-luteo</i>), which is not common, but
very effective in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ligustrum.</span>&mdash;The Privets are of little consequence
as fruit-bearing shrubs, and only <i>L. sinense</i> need be
mentioned; it is frequently very striking in early
winter, being covered then with great clusters of
purple-black, shot-like berries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lycium chinense.</span>&mdash;Nearly all the Box Thorns in
this country belong to this species. As for <i>L. europæum</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and <i>L. barbarum</i>, the names are very common, but
the plants themselves very rare. <i>L. chinense</i> is very
ornamental in the fall of the year, its long graceful
branches being well furnished with rich red berries.
<i>L. rhombifolium</i> is one of its forms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnolia tripetala</span> is occasionally noticeable
in autumn because of its large upright fruits of a
reddish-purple colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maclura aurantiaca</span>, the "Osage Orange," bears
a remarkable orange-coloured fruit 2 to 3 inches
in diameter. The tree is quite hardy, but we have
not heard of its bearing fruit in this country. This
is perhaps because male and female flowers occur
on different plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pernettya mucronata.</span>&mdash;First among ericaceous
plants for beauty in fruit is this Magellanic plant
and its varieties. It is dwarf and bushy, with small
white flowers followed by enormous quantities of
berries about the size of peas. These vary in colour
from white to deep crimson, and are undoubtedly
some of the most valuable of all hardy berry-bearing
shrubs. The varieties are very beautiful.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">WEEPING ELM ON LAWN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paliurus australis</span> (Christ's Thorn) has flat,
disk-like fruits, freely borne in suitable years; they
are green, and if not particularly ornamental, are
very quaint and interesting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptelea trifoliata.</span>&mdash;The same may be said of
the abundant clusters of hop-like fruits seen in this
tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pyrus.</span>&mdash;In this genus, which includes the
Mountain Ash, the Crabs, and the White Beam trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
there is a great wealth of beautiful fruiting trees.
The Mountain Ash or Rowan tree (<i>P. Aucuparia</i>),
when laden with its hanging corymbs of rich scarlet
berries is a delightful picture, and it reaches its full
beauty in August. Not so well known is the variety
<i>fructu-luteo</i>, with yellow fruits. A near relative of the
Rowan tree is <i>P. americana</i>, its New World representative,
but it is not so beautiful. The fruit
is almost identical, but the tree is of a stiff and less
graceful aspect. The new <i>P. thianschanica</i>, which
also belongs to the Rowan tree group, has bright-red,
globose berries. Perhaps of all the genus
Pyrus, none on the whole are so beautiful in autumn
as the Crabs. <i>P. baccata</i>, the Siberian Crab, with its
bright-red, cherry-like fruits, and <i>P. Ringo</i> from
Japan, with bright-yellow ones, are the best of the
true species. The hybrid "John Downie" Crab is
also very beautiful in autumn.</p>

<p>The flowering <span class="smcap">Quinces</span> are not particularly attractive
in regard to the colour of their fruits, but
some of them&mdash;notably those of the dwarf <i>Pyrus
Maulei</i>&mdash;are very sweetly scented.</p>

<p>Some very handsome fruits are borne by the
various White Beam trees (<i>Pyrus Aria</i> and its allies).
Perhaps the best of them is <i>P. lanata</i> (or <i>Sorbus
majestica</i>), which has flat clusters of bright-red
berries. But many of the varieties of <i>P. Aria</i> itself
are very attractive. One of the latest additions to
this group is <i>P. alnifolia</i>, a neat-habited small tree
from Japan and China. It has oblong coral-red
fruits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span>&mdash;Beauty at fruiting time is an almost
proverbial attribute of the Roses. None is more
beautiful than our native Dog Rose (<i>R. canina</i>).
Though in many an English hedgerow, an out-of-the-way
corner in many a garden might be given
up to the Dog Rose and its varieties for the sake
of their wealth of scarlet hips in autumn. <i>R.
tomentosa</i> and <i>R. mollis</i> are other red-fruited natives
of Britain. All the members of the Scotch Rose
group (<i>pimpinellifolia</i>) have black fruits. Of exotic
species, one of the most valuable is <i>R. rugosa</i>; its
flat, orange-shaped hips are so abundant and brightly
coloured that they make a brilliant picture. <i>R. microphylla</i>
has yellow prickly fruits, whilst those of <i>R.
macrophylla</i> are pear-shaped and scarlet. The deep-crimson
hips of <i>R. pomifera</i>, covered with bristly
hairs like large gooseberries, are as remarkable as
any. Some of the American species, although the
fruits are usually small, are handsome, such as <i>R.
nutkana</i> and <i>R. Carolina</i>. The elongated, pear-shaped
fruits of <i>R. alpina</i> and its variety <i>pyrenaica</i> are bright
red, and have a pleasant, resinous odour when rubbed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphiolepis japonica</span>, with its clusters of small,
round black berries, should be planted at least against
a wall; it is a rather slow-growing evergreen shrub
with strawberry-like flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhaphithamnus cyanocarpus</span> can only be grown
outside against a wall, or in Cornwall or similar
localities, but where it will succeed it is well worth
growing, not only for its pale-blue flowers, but for
the bright-blue fruits that follow them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the <span class="smcap">Rhamnus</span>, such as the native <i>R.
catharticus</i> and <i>R. Frangula</i>, bear abundant crops
of purple-black berries.</p>

<p>The dense pyramidal fruit-clusters of the Stag's-horn
Sumach (<i>Rhus typhina</i>) are often attractive,
being covered with crimson hairs. Those of <i>R.
glabra</i> are similarly coloured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubus ph&oelig;nicolasius</span> has spread in cultivation
recently, and has beautiful scarlet berries. It is
hardy enough, but birds are so attracted by the
bright colour, that it requires protection from them
when in fruit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sambucus.</span>&mdash;The scarlet-berried Elder, <i>S. racemosus</i>,
is by far the handsomest of the genus,
but although it flowers freely enough, it is very
uncertain in producing its fruits. <i>S. glauca</i>,
from the West United States, produces large, flat
clusters of blue-white berries, and there is a
striking white-fruited variety of <i>S. nigra</i> called
<i>leucocarpa</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Snowberry</span> (<i>Symphoricarpus racemosus</i>) should
always have a place in the garden for the sake of its
clusters of large pure white berries, which remain
long on the plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Viburnum.</span>&mdash;There are several very handsome
fruiting species in this genus, no finer, however, than
the native <i>V. Opulus</i>, or Guelder Rose, with red
fruits, and its variety <i>fructu-luteo</i> with yellow ones.
In the other native species, <i>V. Lantana</i>, they are at
first red, ultimately black. Several of the Viburnums
are noteworthy for the blue or blue-black fruits; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
these are <i>dentatum</i>, <i>molle</i>, <i>cassinoides</i>, and <i>nudum</i>.
Those of the evergreen <i>V. Tinus</i> are also dark blue,
but, as with the other blue-fruited species, they are
not frequently borne in profusion in the average
climate of Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vitis heterophylla</span> and its variety <i>humulifolia</i>,
bear singularly beautiful clusters of pale china-blue
berries. To induce them to fruit freely, however,
the plants require a warm, sunny wall, and rather
restricted root-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="gap2">WEEPING TREES AND THEIR USES</h3>


<p>It is not at all easy to define special uses for trees
of weeping habit, but it is safe to use them nearly
singly and not in immediate connection with trees
of quite upright form. The point in the weeping
tree is a certain grace of drooping line, such as one
enjoys in the drooping racemes of many of the
papilionaceous flowers such as Wistaria, Laburnum,
and Robinia. Nothing is gained by accentuating
the peculiarity by a direct association with trees of
an opposite way of growth. It is better rather to
place the weeping trees near rounded masses of
shrub and small tree&mdash;for example, a Weeping Birch
would group well with a clump of Rhododendrons.</p>

<p>Near water weeping trees seem to be specially
effective. An instance of this is shown in the
familiar Weeping Willow, but one at a time seems
as much as is wanted.</p>

<p>As a general rule, we strongly advocate planting
in groups, whether in the case of trees, shrubs, or
flowering plants, but the weeping trees are less
suited for grouping than any others. One Weeping
Willow is all very well, but a whole grove of them
would be monotonous and tiresome.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">ELÆAGNUS PUNGENS (Kew).</p>

<p>The habit of some of the weeping trees can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
directly turned to account in the making of arbours
and pergolas; for by planting the large-leaved
Weeping Elm or the Weeping Ash at the back and
on each side in the case of an arbour, or alternately
on each side of the walk for a pergola, a living
shelter may be made in a very few years. The
trees in this case are standards pollarded at about
8 feet from the ground, the form in which they
are generally sent out from the nursery.</p>

<p>Among evergreens the Holly is invaluable. As a
rule the weeping or pendulous varieties are budded
on tall stems of the type, and trained out in an umbrella-like
fashion, thus forming a hollow mound
of greenery. In some places, notably at Brookwood
in Surrey, pendulous Hollies have been allowed to
grow without any attempt at training. Stout stems
10 feet to 12 feet high are surmounted by irregular
heads, which droop down 6 feet or 7 feet, leaving
several feet at the base of the stem bare. In winter
the long pendulous branches, smothered with bright
red berries, are very pleasant. Facing page 248 is
an illustration of a weeping Holly (<i>I. Aquifolium var.
pendula</i>) at Kew. Of variegated weeping Hollies there
are <i>Argentea pendula</i> (Perry's Weeping), with silver
variegated leaves; <i>aurea pendula</i> (Waterer's Weeping),
with gold variegated leaves; and <i>pendula tricolor</i>. To
encourage height rather than width, it is often necessary
to tie up a few of the top shoots, otherwise they
get out of shape; they increase more quickly in width
than height.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">THE USE OF VARIEGATED TREES AND
SHRUBS</h3>


<p>The best use of trees and shrubs with coloured or
variegated foliage is not very easy to determine,
though it may be possible to give a few useful
suggestions. The usual way of planting them here
and there among mixed masses of evergreen and
deciduous growths is perhaps the worst way of all.
All good planting must be done with much thought
and care, and these plants of coloured foliage, that
are necessarily more conspicuous than others, want
the most careful placing of any.</p>

<p>One excellent use of evergreen trees and shrubs
with golden colouring, such as the Gold Hollies,
Cypresses, Yews, and Privets is to make them into
a cheerful bit of outdoor winter garden. The Gold-leaved
Privet is a delightful thing in early winter,
and though Wild Privet, untouched by the knife, is
a deciduous shrub, the clipped Privets of our gardens
usually hold their leaves throughout the winter.
With these the variegated Japan Honeysuckle might
be freely used, much of its yellow veining turning
to a bright red in winter. <i>Cassinia fulvida</i> is another
good winter shrub with its tiny gold-backed leaves.
The pretty bushes of this neat New Zealander are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
apt to grow somewhat straggling, but the crowded
little branches are the very thing that is wanted
through the winter as cut greenery to go with winter
flowers, whether hardy or from under glass. If
these are cut a foot long the bush is kept in shape,
and a valuable supply of stuff for house decoration
is provided.</p>

<p>A half or even quarter acre of well-arranged
planting of these gold-variegated shrubs has a surprisingly
cheery effect in winter, making a kind of
sunlight of its own when skies are grey, and a comfortable
shelter when winds are keen.</p>

<p>In summer, too, it will be beautiful if the spaces
between the shrubs are cleverly planted, for preference,
with plants of white or pale-yellow flowers,
such as White Foxglove, <i>&OElig;nothera lamarckiana</i>, white
and pale-yellow <i>Hibiscus ficifolius</i>, <i>Liliums auratum</i>,
<i>giganteum</i>, <i>speciosum</i>, and <i>longifolium</i>; White Everlasting
Pea trained loosely through any near branches;
<i>Nicotiana affinis</i> and <i>N. sylvestris</i>; and close to the
path hardy Ferns of pale-green frondage, such as
the Lady Fern; with clumps of plants of golden
foliage like the Gold Valerian and Gold Nettle. A
shrub of variegated foliage, planted without special
attention, and coming suddenly in a grouping of
others of an average green colour is made unduly
conspicuous. It should be led up to by neighbours
whose colouring gradually assimilates with its own.
The sudden effect of colouring is all very well in
the nurseryman's show borders, where the object
is to attract attention to showy individuals, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
our gardens we want the effect of well-arranged
pictures rather than that of shop windows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 234px;"><a id="image0027" name="image0027" href="images/illus0137.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">TAURIAN TAMARISK (Tamarix tetrandra), IN FLOWER.</p>

<p>A variegated plant to be of real value in the
garden must have clear, bright, and abundant red
and yellow or white markings, not dotted or merely
margined with colour. So many worthless shrubs
with poor variegation have been named and offered
for sale that it is unwise to buy them from a catalogue.
We may repeat the advice already given, which is
to see them first.</p>

<p>Trees and shrubs with coloured foliage are of
several kinds. Most common of all are those which
have leaves blotched or edged with golden or creamy
yellow and white, such as the variegated Hollies and
Elæagnuses. Then there are those which are only
coloured at a certain season, like <i>Neillia opulifolia aurea</i>.
This has leaves of a beautiful self yellow colour
when they unfold in spring, but become green as
the summer advances; or the variegated Plane
(<i>Platanus acerifolia Süttneri</i>), which is only variegated
in late summer and autumn.</p>

<p>Finally, there are those, like the Purple Hazel or
Purple Beech, which have leaves of one colour and
remain almost of the same shade whilst they are on
the tree.</p>

<p>On the whole the plants that retain their colour
till late summer and autumn, or acquire it then, are
most valuable, because very few trees and shrubs
are then in flower.</p>

<p>Variegated trees and shrubs must not be planted
too plentifully, and studiously avoid all spotty effects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Many a garden would be improved by bringing the
variegated shrubs it contains together so as to produce
a few broad masses of colour. Some of these
shrubs, like Spath's Cornel, or the Golden Elder, may,
in large gardens especially, be planted alone in large
beds or groups. The large trees, like the Purple
Beech, can stand by themselves.</p>

<p>The following list contains about one hundred of
the finest of variegated trees and shrubs:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS FOR SEA-COAST</h3>


<p>In planting trees and shrubs near the sea, two important
matters must be considered&mdash;(1) fierce gales;
(2) salt spray. As a protection against storms much
may be done by planting quick-growing things, such
as Poplars and Willows, and in this sheltered area
more permanent trees and shrubs may be put. This
way of planting for shelter where bleak places are
to be clothed with trees and shrubs is universally
adopted in some form or other, sometimes in the
shape of hedges or belts, and in the other cases
the plants are all placed much thicker together than
they are to permanently remain, thus forming a
compact mass against which the wind makes little or
no impression. In this last-named case continual
thinning will be necessary as they grow up, for if
left too long the plants become weak, and the
advantage gained by the thicker planting is then
completely lost. A beautiful seaside shrub, and
the best, too, for forming shelter hedges of low or
medium height is the Tamarisk, which retains its
freshness throughout the season till the autumn,
however much exposed to the sea.</p>

<p>It is difficult to make a list of trees and shrubs
suitable for seaside planting around the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Isles, as the coast-line is so varied, and the action
of the Gulf Stream has great influence on the
vegetation of many parts of our western coasts.
As no hard and fast line can be drawn, the first
list contains those trees and shrubs that may be
regarded as thoroughly hardy, unless otherwise
specified, and the second list those that are available
for planting in the Isle of Wight, in the
south and west of England, and in some parts
of Ireland.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS FOR WIND-SWEPT
GARDENS</h3>


<p>Few trees and shrubs are happy in bleak and exposed
gardens. The hardiest should be used to form
a shelter belt, as every leaf and twig helps to break
the force of the wind, whereas solid obstacles, such
as walls, merely serve to divert its course. In planting
spots much exposed to the wind, put the trees
much closer than it is intended they should remain
permanently, as the young plants serve to shelter
one another, and encourage, therefore, a quicker
growth. When they get crowded, gradually thin
them out. The trees and shrubs should always come
from exposed nurseries, as the growth is stout and
sturdy. Growth made in warm valleys is more
sappy. The following trees and shrubs can be
depended upon in most windy places:&mdash;</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Trees</h3>

<blockquote><p>Acer platanoides (Norway Maple) and Acer Pseudo-platanus
(Sycamore). While not equal to some of the trees mentioned,
these Maples do well in many places and form a
distinct feature.</p>

<p>Betula alba (Common Birch). An extremely graceful tree and
a universal favourite.</p>

<p>Cratægus Oxyacantha (Hawthorn). The principal effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
exposure is to make the growth more stunted than
would otherwise be the case.</p>

<p>Fagus sylvatica (Beech). Long recognised as a good shelter
tree, its value in this respect is increased by the fact that
many leaves often shrivel on the branches instead of
dropping, thus giving additional protection in winter.</p>

<p>Fraxinus Excelsior (Ash). The wide-spreading roots of this
anchor it securely in position, and the leaves do not
weigh down the branches to any great extent.</p>

<p>Ilex Aquifolium (Holly). Though of slow growth when young,
this, when once established, grows away freely and is
indifferent to wind.</p>

<p>Larix europæa (Larch). This is well known as a nurse tree
for bleak places.</p>

<p>Picea (Abies) excelsa (Norway Spruce). One of our commonest
Conifers, hence it is often used as a nurse tree
for choicer subjects.</p>

<p>Pinus austriaca (Austrian Fir). The best of all evergreens for
bleak places; Pinus Cembra (Swiss Stone Pine), of slow
growth, but very ornamental, and does not mind the
wind.</p>

<p>Pinus Laricio (Corsican Pine, or Black Pine). As indifferent
to exposure as P. austriaca, P. montana (dwarf), and P.
sylvestris (Scotch Fir), a well-known native, which often
crowns high hill-tops.</p>

<p>Populus alba (Abele), P. fastigiata (Lombardy Poplar), P.
deltoidea (Canadian Poplar), P. nigra (Black Poplar),
and P. tremula (Aspen). In low-lying districts all these
Poplars are of rapid growth, but in exposed places they
make much slower progress. Even then they grow
quicker than most shelter plants, and are valuable for
making an effective display more quickly than some of
the more permanent subjects. These can all be readily
cut back within reasonable limits if desired.</p>

<p>Quercus Robur (Oak).</p>

<p>Robinia Pseudacacia. The false Acacia is one of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
town trees we have; indeed, it does well almost everywhere.</p>

<p>Salix alba (White Willow). This will pass unscathed through
fierce storms. In fairly dry spots the rate of progress is
much slower than in moister soil, but, as a set-off, the
silvery hue of the foliage is more pronounced.</p>

<p>Ulmus (Elm). The best of the Elms for this purpose is the
Wych Elm, and one known as the Wheatley is also good.</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Shrubs</h3>

<blockquote><p>Atriplex Halimus (Sea Purslane). A silvery-leaved, free-growing
shrub, indifferent to soil or situation.</p>

<p>Berberis (the Barberry). The best of these are the strong-growing
Berberis aristata, and the common Berberis
vulgaris, with its several varieties.</p>

<p>Colutea arborescens (Bladder Senna). The golden flowers in
early summer and the large inflated seed-pods in autumn
are both attractive.</p>

<p>Cotoneaster buxifolia, Nummularia, and Simonsii. These are
all pretty berry-bearing shrubs.</p>

<p>Cytisus albus (White Broom), Cytisus scoparius (Yellow
Broom), and its varieties.</p>

<p>Deutzia crenata flore-pleno. A handsome flowering shrub
and the most robust of its class.</p>

<p>Euonymus europæus (Spindle tree). The fruits of this are
very ornamental in the autumn.</p>

<p>Halimodendron argenteum (Siberian Salt Bush). A pretty
rambling shrub, with silvery leaves.</p>

<p>Juniperus communis and J. Sabina (Savin). The fact that
these Junipers are evergreen is a point in their favour.</p>

<p>Ligustrum ovalifolium, ovalifolium elegantissimum, and vulgare.
These Privets are well known for planting where
the conditions are none too favourable.</p>

<p>Lycium chinense (Box Thorn). A rambling shrub holding
its own almost anywhere.</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">CONIFERS (INCLUDING PINES) IN
ORNAMENTAL PLANTING</h3>


<p>Those who take a serious interest in their gardens
and other planted grounds are so rapidly acquiring
a better comprehension of the art in its wider aspects,
and are so willingly receptive of further suggestion,
that we emphasise a lesson that we have often tried
to teach, namely, the importance of planting in large
groups of one thing at a time, and of a right choice.</p>

<p>There is no more common mistake made than that
of planting just the wrong things in the wrong places.
Thus we see plantations of Spruce on dry, sandy
hill-tops, from whence the poor trees must look with
longing eyes to their true home in the moist, alluvial
soil of the valley-bottom below. In mixed plantations
we see Conifers from many climes and all altitudes,
all expected to do equally well in perhaps one
small space of garden ground. If in a projected
plantation there is space for only fifty trees, how
much better it would be first to ascertain which out
of a few kinds would be best suited to the soil and
general conditions of the place, and then out of this
selection to choose the one that best fits the planter's
own liking and will be most in harmony with the
further planting scheme that he has in view. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
way he will obtain that unity of effect that alone can
make a garden or piece of planted ground pictorial
and restful, and enable to serve as a becoming setting
to the brightly-coloured flowering plants that will
then show their proper value as jewels of the garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 155px;"><a id="image0037" name="image0037" href="images/illus0166.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0166th.jpg" width="155" height="233" alt="LIBOCEDRUS DECURRENS AT FROGMORE (about 65 feet high)." title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">LIBOCEDRUS DECURRENS AT FROGMORE (about 65 feet high).</p>

<p>In this restrained and sober use of trees, and
especially of Conifers, it is well to plant them of
several ages, the youngest to the outer edges of the
groups. If there is plenty of space it will be all the
better to plant the trees in hundreds rather than in
fifties, or in any case in spaces large enough to see
one whole picture of one good tree at a time.
Where such a planting was wisely made from forty
to sixty years ago how fine the effect is to-day, as
in the case of the grand growth of Douglas Firs at
Murthly. No one seeing so fine an example of the
use of one tree at a time could wish that the plantation
had been mixed, or could be otherwise than
deeply impressed with the desirability of the plan.</p>

<p>One such large group can always be made to
merge into another by intergrouping at the edges,
beginning by an isolated tree of group B in the
further portion of group A, then a group of two or
three of B, until the process is reversed and the
group is all of B, with single ones of A giving place
to all B. There is no reason why the same principle
should not be used with two or three kinds of
combined grouping, but then it should be of trees
harmonious among themselves, as of Spruce and
Silver Fir, or of such things as represent the natural
mixture of indigenous growth. Thus the Yew, Box,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Viburnum, Dogwood, Privet, and Thorn of a wild
chalky waste might be taken as a guide to planting
some of these with nearly allied foreign kinds. But
the important thing in all such planting is to have
the satisfactory restfulness and beauty of harmony
that can only be obtained by the right and limited
choice of material.</p>

<p>Although a few Conifers are deciduous, such as
the Maidenhair tree (<i>Ginkgo biloba</i>), <i>Taxodium distichum</i>,
the Golden Larch (<i>Pseudolarix Kæmpferi</i>), and the
true Larches, the great bulk of the family consists
of evergreens. It is to the Coniferæ, indeed, that
belong the only hardy evergreen trees which in
stature and size rival the large deciduous trees of
cool temperate latitudes. Although our only native
Conifers are the Yew, the Scotch Pine, and the
Juniper, there is a sufficient variety of soil and
climate within the limits of the British Isles to
provide suitable conditions for nearly the whole of
the family. It is only a few sub-tropical species that
cannot be accommodated. This does not imply that
the whole of the hardy Conifers can be grown satisfactorily
in any one place. In even the best Conifer
localities there are some species that will not reach
perfection, and in the general run of gardens there is
a considerable proportion of species about which
the same must be said. This fact, however, has
often been overlooked.</p>

<p>The extreme popularity of Conifers, which was at
its height from forty to fifty years ago, undoubtedly
led to the enriching of the parks and gardens of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
country with what are now, in many instances,
magnificent specimens. To realise how great that
enrichment was, one has only to mention such
places as Dropmore, Murthly Castle, Ochtertyre.
But Conifer planting, from both artistic and merely
cultural points of view, was overdone. Conifers
began to fill an undue proportion of space in gardens,
and displaced to a large extent the beautiful flower-bearing
deciduous vegetation whose seasonable variations
give such charm and interest. With all their
symmetry and richness of hue, the popular species
of Abies and Picea often have a heavy, even sombre,
aspect. Heavy masses of Pine, Spruce, and Fir can
never give that changing aspect in the landscape that
comes with deciduous vegetation. The tender tints
of spring, the flowers, the gold and purple of autumn,
it is to these that the seasons of our northern
latitudes owe their greatest delights.</p>

<p>Perhaps the worst of all the uses to which Conifers
have been put is that of forming long avenues
across parks. It is difficult to understand the
frame of mind that would prefer rows of <i>Araucaria</i>,
<i>Abies nobilis</i>, or other similar things&mdash;however well
grown and pyramidal they might be&mdash;to a noble
vista of Chestnut, Oak, or Lime, with its canopy of
branch and foliage overhead. Conifers can, however,
be used effectively for forming short avenues within
the garden itself, especially in the more trimly-kept
parts.</p>

<p>The practice that is frequently adopted of forming
a pinetum and bringing together the members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
this family in one part of the grounds is a very good
one. It is far better than sprinkling them indiscriminately
over the whole garden. At the same
time, where sufficient space is not available for the
formation of a pinetum they may be used in their
proper proportion with other evergreens in various
parts of the garden. Single specimens on lawns of
Abies, Picea, and of many other genera are always
effective, and nothing in the whole range of native
or foreign trees is more stately and picturesque
than the Cedar of Lebanon. How much do we
of the present day owe to those who a century
or more ago planted this tree so abundantly in this
country!</p>

<p>Before planting Conifers largely in any garden
where they are to be grown for their purely
ornamental qualities, a study should be made of
the species planted in other gardens where the
conditions as to soil, moisture, and altitude are
similar. On the peaty formations in Surrey and
Hampshire where Rhododendrons succeed so well,
many Conifers thrive exceedingly well also. The
Common Spruce and its allies are nearly all failures
on light dry soil, especially where the subsoil is
gravel. In places, however, where the Spruces fail,
the Common Larch and the Lawson Cypress succeed
well. In chalk districts many Conifers refuse to
grow, but the following are among those that
thrive: <i>Abies magnifica</i>, <i>A. nobilis</i>, <i>A. nordmanniana</i>,
and <i>A. Pinsapo</i>, the Cedars, <i>Cupressus lawsoniana</i>,
<i>C. macrocarpa</i>, and <i>C. nootkatensis</i>, the Maidenhair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
tree, the Junipers, the Thuyas, the Yews, and the
following Pines: <i>Pinus Laricio</i> and <i>P. austriaca</i>,
the Scotch Pine, <i>P. excelsa</i>, and <i>P. Pinaster</i>. Most
of the Pines, too, are happy on gravelly or stony
ground.</p>

<p>None of the Silver Firs (<i>Abies</i>) or Spruces (<i>Picea</i>)
are good trees for planting at the seaside, unless
there is sufficient shelter to break the force of the
wind, and even then there are very few that will
succeed. The species most suitable for planting
where there is a thick outer belt are <i>Abies nobilis</i>,
<i>A. concolor</i>, <i>A. nordmanniana</i>, and <i>A. pectinata</i>, the
Common Silver Fir. Of the Spruces, <i>Picea nigra</i> and
<i>P. alba</i>, the North American Spruces, succeed better
than the Norway Spruce, <i>P. excelsa</i>, but these, like the
Silver Firs, must have the shelter of a good wind break;
<i>Picea pungens</i>, <i>P. pungens glauca</i>, and <i>P. Engelmanni</i>
will not succeed in exposed places, even in inland
localities, and fail entirely by the sea. There is a
difference of opinion about <i>Engelmanni</i>. In some
places it seems to stand winds well. The Conifers
that will thrive by the sea are very few, and probably
not more than half-a-dozen kinds can be trusted.
The finest of all is undoubtedly <i>Pinus Pinaster</i>, which
is essentially a sea-coast Pine, revelling in storms and
sprays. For warmer parts, is the Aleppo Pine (<i>P.
halepensis</i>), but is only for southern and warm
coasts. <i>P. insignis</i> is somewhat tender, but stands
the sea gales fairly well, and <i>P. austriaca</i>, and its
relative, <i>P. Laricio</i>, are both excellent, specially for
making the first barrier against the winds. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
hardy Scotch Pine (<i>P. sylvestris</i>), if planted in large
masses, grows well, but does not luxuriate close to
the sea, and is especially liable to be browned in
foliage by the salt spray.</p>

<p>Besides the Pines, one of the finest of Conifers is
the Monterey Cypress (<i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i>), which
is hardy everywhere on the coast in these islands;
it grows finer than it does in its home on the
Pacific coast. It makes a fine front barrier against
the wind, especially when mixed with the foregoing
Pines. The variety <i>C. lambertiana</i> is also excellent.
There are two other Conifers which, though not
much planted by the sea-coast, will, we believe,
prove reliable; these are <i>Cedrus atlantica</i> and <i>Thuya
gigantea</i> (sometimes called <i>T. Lobbii</i>). A third Conifer
that we have seen doing well by the sea is <i>Abies
Pinsapo</i>, but it must have a temporary shelter
in its small state. This subject of seaside planting&mdash;the
most difficult in a tree planter's practice&mdash;is an
important one, and it is only possible to treat the
matter generally.</p>

<p>The Conifer family is especially noteworthy for
the way many of its species vary. Not only is
this propensity evidenced in such characters as the
colour of the leaf and the differences in habit; it
shows itself more remarkably sometimes in the form
and texture of the leaf and mode of branching.
So great is the difference between some forms of
certain species of Conifers that they have been
placed in different genera. What are generally
known as Retinosporas, for instance, are really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
nothing more than forms, "states" the botanists
term them, assumed by various species of Thuya
and Cupressus. Strictly speaking, <i>Retinospora</i> has
no separate existence as a genus. This, however,
is a botanical phase of the matter. Horticulturally
we are more concerned with such variations as
adapt the plants to various garden purposes. Many
quaint and dainty forms of large trees are very
suitable for the rock-garden in association with other
alpine plants. The Common Spruce, for instance,
has given birth to many pigmy forms. The Yew,
the Scotch Pine, and various others have "sported"
in a similar way. But no hardy tree varies so
much, perhaps, as the Lawson Cypress when raised
from seed. The species has assumed almost every
shade of colour that Conifers do assume, and every
form of growth. Beautiful golden, variegated, pendulous,
and erect varieties have been raised, and not
only from the Lawson Cypress, but from many other
Conifers also. The Golden Yews, the yellow form
of the Monterey Cypress, and the golden variety of
the Scotch Pine, may be recommended to those who
require this colour, although in the Pine it only shows
itself in winter. The blue-white or glaucous hue
that is more or less present in most Conifers, shows
itself most conspicuously in the Blue Spruce (<i>Picea
pungens glauca</i>), in <i>Cedrus atlantica glauca</i>, in the
new Cork Fir from Arizona (<i>Abies lasiocarpa var.
arizonica</i>), and in <i>Abies concolor violacea</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">The Propagation of Conifers</h3>

<p>Many mistakes have been made in propagating
the Coniferæ, and to make matters still worse, the
old erroneous doctrines are still preached and
practised. The unpopularity of certain species of
Abies, Picea, and Pinus is due to a great extent
to the practice of grafting them on unsuitable stocks.
For instance, the species of Abies are worked on
<i>A. pectinata</i>, of Picea on <i>P. excelsa</i>, and of Pinus
on <i>P. sylvestris</i> or <i>P. Laricio</i>. The varieties of <i>P.
excelsa</i> are worked on that species. <i>P. excelsa</i> is <i>not</i>
used for the other forms of spruce Firs to any great
extent. In addition to this, such methods and stocks
are still spoken of as the correct ones to use; though,
to take one genus alone, what kind of a specimen
<i>Abies bracteata</i>, <i>A. nobilis</i>, or <i>A. concolor</i> would make
in twenty years' time if worked on <i>A. pectinata</i> we
should not like to say&mdash;certainly very poor, even if
they lived, which is doubtful. These are nearly
always raised from imported seeds. It may be laid
down as a law that <i>species</i> of Coniferæ should never
be grafted but raised from seed, which can always be
obtained through English firms. With varietal forms
of Coniferæ that will not come true from seed or
that cannot be struck as cuttings, grafting must
be resorted to, and if young plants of the type
species are used as stocks the results will be fairly
satisfactory. In the case of some of the more
highly variegated Cupressus, &amp;c., grafting is really
the best method of propagation, as these forms are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
mostly of weak constitution and are not satisfactory
from cuttings. In the following list the best methods
of propagation are given with each genus, together
with special mention of those forms which are of
indifferent growth though not difficult to propagate:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juniperus.</span>&mdash;The Junipers should be raised from
seeds, though some of them do fairly well if propagated
by cuttings. The green and glaucous varieties
of <i>J. chinensis</i>, <i>J. excelsa</i>, <i>J. virginiana</i>, and <i>J. communis</i>
root easily from cuttings, or can be layered with
success. The variegated forms are best grafted on
stocks of the species they belong to, and <i>J. Sabina</i>
(the Savin) and its varieties are easily raised from
cuttings or layers, the latter being a very easy way
of propagating them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cupressus.</span>&mdash;This genus is divided into two
sections, viz., the true Cypresses, represented by
<i>C. macrocarpa</i>, <i>C. sempervirens</i>, &amp;c., and Chamæcyparis,
of which <i>Cupressus lawsoniana</i> is the best
known species. With the former section seeds
are the best means of reproducing the species,
while the few varieties should be grafted on stocks
of the parent species. The handsome <i>C. macrocarpa
var. lutea</i> especially should be worked on the type, as
it is practically a failure from cuttings, and if grafted
on <i>C. lawsoniana</i>, as is sometimes done, it makes a
short, stumpy bush instead of a typically tall columnar
tree. In the Chamæcyparis section <i>Cupressus
lawsoniana</i>, <i>C. nootkatensis</i>, <i>C. obtusa</i>, <i>C. pisifera</i>, and
<i>C. thyoides</i> are the only species, though there are
a host of varieties attached to them, the forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the three latter species, in fact, including all the
various plants more commonly known under the
generic title of Retinospora. The species should
be raised from seed, which is easily obtainable and
germinates readily, or in default they will root from
cuttings. The varieties, with a few exceptions, are
quickly propagated by cuttings, those that require
to be grafted being <i>C. lawsoniana var. lutea</i>, the
variegated forms of <i>C. nootkatensis</i>, and <i>C. obtusa
vars. nana</i>, <i>nana aurea</i>, and <i>filifera aurea</i>. The
forms of <i>C. thyoides</i> also do well when raised from
layers. We must not omit also such varieties of
<i>C. lawsoniana</i> as <i>Fraseri</i>, <i>Allumi</i>, and one known in
nurseries as Milford Blue Jacket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thuya.</span>&mdash;These are propagated in much the same
way as the Cupressus, viz., the species by seeds, and
the varieties by cuttings or by grafting in the case of
the one or two highly variegated forms. Some of
the green or glaucous varieties of both Cupressus
and Thuya will come fairly true from seed, from
40 per cent. to 70 per cent. being the usual quantity
of seedlings true to name. Variegated forms from
seed either come green or a mongrel mixture of
green and variegated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Libocedrus.</span>&mdash;This should be raised from seed,
as when grafted on <i>Thuya orientalis</i>&mdash;a too common
method of propagation&mdash;it makes a miserable specimen.
The middle pair of scales in the cone of
Libocedrus alone contain fertile seeds. <i>L. doniana</i>
is a tender species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sciadopitys</span> and <span class="smcap">Taxodium</span>.&mdash;These can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
propagated by seeds, and the young plants should
have a fairly moist position with plenty of leaf-mould
or peat to grow in afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sequoia.</span>&mdash;The two species of Sequoia should
be raised from seed, and the three or four varieties
be grafted on the type species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cryptomeria.</span>&mdash;This only contains one species,
viz., <i>C. japonica</i>, which can only be obtained from
seed, or by cuttings; and the varieties root readily
as cuttings, though one or two of the weaklier ones
do better if grafted on <i>C. japonica</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Araucaria.</span>&mdash;Propagate by seeds, which, though
sometimes difficult to obtain, germinate freely and
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tsuga.</span>&mdash;The Hemlock Spruces are easily and
quickly obtained from seeds, and one or two will
strike from cuttings; the varieties do best when
grafted on the species they belong to, though <i>T.
pattoniana var. glauca</i>, more commonly known as
<i>Abies hookeriana</i>, will come fairly true from seed,
about 75 per cent. being the usual quantity if the
seed is obtained from good plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picea.</span>&mdash;This genus has been mentioned before
as being commonly grafted on <i>P. excelsa</i> (the
Common Spruce), which is an easy way of obtaining
young plants, which, however, cannot be recommended
to form good specimens in after years.
The species of Picea should all be raised from seed,
and the many named varieties of <i>P. excelsa</i> should be
grafted on the parent species. At least one-half the
plants of <i>P. Engelmanni var. glauca</i> and <i>P. pungens var.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
glauca</i> (the Californian Blue Spruce) will be found
true to name when raised from seeds, while their
superiority afterwards over grafted plants is evident.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cedrus, Larix, and Pseudolarix.</span>&mdash;It should
always be remembered that these three are quite
distinct genera, and for purposes of propagation
should never be used in conjunction with each
other, the first being evergreen and the two latter
deciduous. The species of all three should be
raised from seed; the varieties of Cedrus should
be grafted on that genus, the forms of Larix on the
Larch, though the geographical forms of the Common
Larch, such as <i>var. rossica</i> and <i>var. sibirica</i>, usually
come true from seed. <i>Larix leptolepis</i> (Japanese
Larch) is one of the most beautiful trees ever introduced
from Japan; it is charming both in summer
and winter. <i>Pseudolarix Kæmpferi</i> (Golden Larch),
the only representative of the genus, must be raised
from seed; it is generally raised by grafting in
February under glass on stocks of the common
Larch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abies.</span>&mdash;In this genus some of the most handsome
Conifers are found, and also some of the most
difficult to grow. All the Abies should be propagated
by seeds, but if seed of the varieties cannot
be obtained then they must be grafted on the
parent species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pseudotsuga.</span>&mdash;This genus only contains one
species, viz., <i>P. Douglasii</i> (the Douglas Fir), which
is propagated readily by seed, the seedlings being
of rapid growth and soon form good plants. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
few varieties are grafted on the type, though the
majority will come fairly true from seed, which,
however, is not always to be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pinus.</span>&mdash;Perhaps no Conifer adds so much to the
beauty of the landscape in winter as the Pine. All
the species should be raised from seeds, and any
green or glaucous varieties can also be propagated
in the same way if seeds can be obtained. The
golden, dwarf, and variegated Pines must be grafted
on the species they are varieties of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taxaceæ.</span>&mdash;This group is usually associated with
Coniferæ, from which it differs chiefly by the seed
being nearly or quite enclosed in a fleshy envelope
instead of in a cone, the fruit of some resembling
a small Plum, but a typical fruit is seen in that
of the Common Yew. The hardy genera are <i>Ginkgo
biloba</i> (the Maidenhair tree), which is propagated
from seed&mdash;the plant is deciduous and slow growing;
Cephalotaxus and Torreya are propagated by
seeds, cuttings, or layers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taxus</span> (the Yew).&mdash;There are only three or four
species of Taxus, but there are a great many varieties
of the Common Yew, many being very handsome.
The species are easily raised from seeds, layers,
or cuttings. The first two methods are the best,
cuttings being very slow in growth, but as seed
is very plentiful in most years this is the quickest
and best means of propagation. Some of the
varieties will come true from seed; the Irish Yew,
however, must be struck from cuttings, as seedlings
never come true. The more highly variegated Yews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
grow quickest when grafted on the Common Yew,
and as they always keep good in after years this
method can for once be recommended. A very
good species for a lawn is <i>T. cuspidata</i>; it is strong
in growth and spreading.</p>

<p>Propagate <span class="smcap">Prumnopitys</span> and <span class="smcap">Saxegothea</span> by
seeds, cuttings, or layers.</p>

<p class="caption">AVENUE OF ANCIENT YEWS AT MURTHLY.</p>

<p>The following account of a great Conifer garden
in Scotland is important, as showing how certain of
the better-known species have behaved during the
last fifty years or so. It is taken from the <i>Garden</i> of
May 19, 1900:&mdash;</p>

<p>The second quarter of the present century saw
the introduction of a large number of Conifers
hitherto unknown to English gardens. Their cultivation
was eagerly taken up, and especially in Scotland,
a land whose general conditions seem highly
favourable to a considerable number of species, much
success has been attained. It may still be premature
to state with any degree of assurance what may be
the ultimate suitability of many of these Conifers for
growth in our islands. The lifetime of a tree is not
comprised within its first sixty years, and such a
length of time is all too short to prove the ultimate
success of any new tree, though within that space
it may come to a magnificent size and apparent
promise. Such a state is shown by the splendid
Douglas Firs in the grounds of Murthly Castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Perthshire, where also many another exotic Conifer
is grown in quantity.</p>

<p>These words of Sir William Thiselton-Dyer, that
formed part of his opening address on the second
day of the Conifer conference of the Royal Horticultural
Society in 1891, may here be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Any one who had not travelled in Scotland could
form no idea of the extent to which rare Conifers
were cultivated in that country, and the splendid
development which they attained. The chairman,
by way of illustrating these remarks, directed the
attention of the audience to some large photographs
representing specimens of Coniferæ to be seen at
Murthly Castle, Perthshire, where they flourished,
and where stately and magnificent examples 70 feet,
80 feet, and 100 feet high were to be met with.
Such trees could only be seen in Scotland, and were
the result of a peculiar association of physical conditions.
In the south-west of England it was impossible
to find a parallel, though even on the sunburnt
soil of Kew good specimens of the Pines proper were
occasionally to be seen. With regard to the Abies,
however&mdash;that section of Conifers of which the
Spruces may be taken as a type&mdash;a state of things
prevailed in Scotland which could not be rivalled in
England. On the other hand, the climate in the
south-west of the latter country was fairly suitable
for some other Conifers, and many of the fine
Mexican Pines could be grown there."</p>

<p>Of the remarkable Douglas Fir at Dropmore, Mr.
Charles Herrin on the same occasion says: "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
monarch Douglas Fir, planted in 1830, has attained
a height of 120 feet, girth of trunk 11 feet 9 inches,
with beautiful spreading branches sweeping the
ground, covering a diameter of 64 feet. The leaves
are also of a glaucous hue, equalling in that respect
many of the plants now sold from nurseries under
the name of <i>Douglasi glauca</i>.... Many trees have
since been raised from its seeds and planted out on
the estate; one, planted in 1843, is now 78 feet
high, with a girth of trunk of 8 feet 2 inches,
spreading 39 feet in diameter at base; a perfect
specimen."</p>

<p>By comparing the growth of the latter tree with
the Murthly table, it will be seen that the trees
make their growth much more rapidly in Scotland.
The Murthly Conifers were all planted by Sir William
and Sir Douglas Stewart. The present owner, Mr.
Steuart Fothringham, who measured the trees in
1891 in anticipation of the visit of the Scottish
Arboricultural Society, on learning that we should
be glad to know their increase of growth since that
date, has been so good as to have the same trees
measured again, the increase being shown by the
subjoined table on p. 128.</p>

<p>Mr. Fothringham also furnishes the following
remarks: "The measurements were all carefully
taken by sending men or boys up the trees, not by
dendrometers, and are, I believe, correct. There
are something like eighty or a hundred different
varieties growing at Murthly, but some of them are
young and only experiments. Those measured and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
noted are the most striking; they are nearly all
growing in large numbers. The remarks appended
to the table are made by Mr. James Laurie, the
gardener, who knows Conifers well. The only additional
notes I have made are the following: <i>Picea
sitchensis</i> will never, in my opinion, supplant the
Spruce. <i>Picea orientalis</i> is not as free-growing as the
Spruce, but quite as hardy. <i>Araucaria imbricata.</i>&mdash;Many
of these were damaged by severe frost. <i>Cedrus
Deodara</i> will not, in my opinion, live to great age in
our climate. <i>Cupressus thyoides.</i>&mdash;This particular tree
was so much broken by branches blown off its
neighbour that I cut it down. <i>Pinus monticola</i> has
been attacked by a parasitic growth that is likely to
destroy all the young growth and probably the trees.
<i>Juniperus recurva</i> was severely injured by the hard
frost. By the hard frost I mean the winter of
1894-5. In February 1895, the thermometer was
for several days below 0 Fahr., and on one night
went to 11° below 0. This shows that all these trees
will stand great cold at the time of year that it is
likely to come, but late frosts in spring, when the sap
has begun to rise, are detrimental to the young
shoots of those that start their growth early in the
season. There are at Murthly, besides Coniferæ,
fine specimens of Yews, Oaks, Beech, Spanish Chestnut,
Horse Chestnut, and Sycamore."</p>

<h3 class="gap2">CARE OF OLD TREES</h3>


<p>The charm of many an estate is not the garden or
the woodland, but the monarchs that for years have
weathered the winter storm and stand out as noble
specimens of their family. Often there are fine trees
of rarer species which their owners naturally wish to
preserve from decay as long as possible. Belonging
to this class are numerous specimens scattered over
the country of American and other foreign trees that
were amongst the first of their kind to be introduced
to Britain, such, for instance, as the Tulip tree, the
Robinia, and various oaks from America, the Sophora
from China, and various European trees. The trees
may have some historic associations, but whether this
is so or not, when they begin to decay efforts are made
to save them from absolute death. Decay is harmful
and objectionable in park and garden, and we are
not sure that this matter of decay in trees has been
so well considered as it might be, as bearing upon
the health of other trees and of mankind also. A
tree may be picturesque in decay, but we prefer it
in health and beauty. Experts are frequently asked
for remedies to arrest decay in old trees.</p>

<p>The two principal causes of decay are starvation
at the root and injury by storms and disease. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
trees as the Beech and Horse Chestnut, that root
close to the surface of the soil&mdash;quite different from
the Oak&mdash;may often be invigorated by covering the
ground with a few inches of good soil or short
manure. Artificial watering, during prolonged
drought, when thoroughly done, is also very helpful
to the tree. Trees with large crowns of branches
are frequently seen thinly furnished with foliage, and
altogether sickly owing to unhealthy or insufficient
roots. The balance between top and bottom has
been destroyed. To restore it in some degree the
top-growth may be reduced by pruning out and
shortening back branches here and there, wherever
it can be done without spoiling the appearance of
the tree. This demands careful judgment, but some
old and sickly trees may certainly be restored in a
measure by this help. It is of no value in the case
of trees with decayed trunks, nor with those like our
Common Oak, which will not break readily from
old wood. But Elms, Robinias, and Red Oaks are
among those that respond to this treatment.</p>

<p>Old trees with insecure branches can often be
saved from destruction by fastening the main
branches together on to the trunk. The common
practice of putting an iron collar round the branch
is a mistake. The iron prevents the branch expanding
naturally, and ultimately chokes it. A better
way is to use a strong iron rod with a plate at the
end, and instead of supporting the branch by
encircling it, a hole is bored right through the
centre of it, through which the rod is pushed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the outer side. The rod should be of tough iron
or steel, and should exactly fit the hole bored by the
augur; the portions embedded in the wood should
be smeared with coal tar before they are pushed
through, so as to make the holes as nearly as possible
air and water-tight. One end of the rod should
be "threaded" sufficiently to allow of the limbs being
braced slightly by screwing up the nut, and thus
supporting some of their weight. Finally, the bark
should be neatly cut away so as to let in each of the
iron plates closer to the living wood, for by this
means the time required for closing over the plate
by new wood is shortened. In this way the weight
is borne by the iron plate, which should, by removing
sufficient bark, be allowed to fit close in to the
wood. New bark will gradually close over and hide
the plate, and instead of an ugly collar cutting into
the wood, the only evidence of artificial aid is the rod
coming from the inner side of the branch.</p>

<p>Branches or snags that have to be removed should
be sawn off quite close to the trunk or larger branch
from which they spring. When a stump, even not
more than a few inches long, is left, the new bark
and wood are unable to close over it, and the wood
ultimately decays and acts as a medium for moisture
and fungoid diseases. The saw should travel
from point A to B, as in the sketch. When a stump
is left (as would be done by sawing off at C D) decay
sets in sooner or later. Although the tree often
succeeds in healing over the dead part, it more often
fails to do so until the decay has reached the trunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
itself. With the softer-wooded trees like the Horse-Chestnuts
disease frequently reaches the heart of the
tree quickly by these means. A coating of liquid tar
over the wound, renewed once or twice until the
new bark has closed over, is a sure protection against
these evils.</p>

<p>A good deal may be done in the early training of
a tree to so control its
building up that it may
best withstand the violence
of gales. And
the most important matter
in this connexion is
the development of a
strong erect trunk, a
central axis of such
height and strength and
bulk as to be capable
of supporting its head
of branches easily. In
other words the leading
shoot should always be
watched, and, by the repression
of any rival leaders that may appear, allowed
to retain its predominance. In the best English
nurseries only trees with good "leads" are sent out.</p>

<p>Trees decayed in the centre, with only an outer
layer of healthy wood, are, of course, doomed, but
by filling up all holes in the earlier stages of decay,
and thus keeping out moisture, their term of life can
be lengthened by many years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Holes made by woodpeckers can sometimes be
plugged up with a piece of Oak. This, if left on a
level with the bark, will often enable the latter to
close over the hole. Large holes may be filled with
cement, or even built up with bricks, the surface
being made water-tight and tarred over.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS FOR WATERSIDE</h3>


<p>Many of the brightest garden pictures at the present
day are by the well-planted pond or lakeside, where
shrubs of large growth are grouped to give colour
through summer and winter.</p>

<p>The wild plants of the riverside are in themselves
for the most part large of stature and important of
appearance. When one sees the upright growth and
large leaves of the Great Water Dock (Rumex) and
the broad round ones (2 feet or more across) of the
Butter-Bur (Petasites), and the beds of the Common
Reed (Phragmites), 8 to 10 feet high, with its
great brown-black plumes, and the curious bright-green
Horsetail (Equisetum), and the rosy banks of
Willow-herb and Loose-strife, and the calm wide
breadths of the white Water Lily in the still backwaters;
when we see all these lessons that Nature
teaches by the riverside we perceive that for the
best of good effect of waterside gardening we need
not be afraid of planting things of bold growth
largely.</p>

<p class="caption">ALDERS NEAR WATER (Catkin time).</p>

<p>When we come to garden plants there are many
families that are never so happy as when close to
water, or in soil that always feels the cool, moistening
influence of water within a few feet below them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Such are the whole range of the larger herbaceous
Spiræas, some of them plants of great size. Then
we have the Thalictrums, the autumn-flowering
Phloxes, the stately Heracleum; Telekia, Bamboos,
<i>Arundo Donax</i>, the Swamp and Meadow Lilies of
the northern states of America; and coming to
smaller though scarcely less important plants, the
Scarlet Lobelias, Oriental Poppies, many Irises, the
Michaelmas Daisies, and Day Lilies; all these thrive
by the waterside.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS FOR THE ROCK GARDEN</h3>


<p>If we think of the changes in gardening terms which
have occurred during the last quarter of a century,
there is surely significance in the gradual transition
from the Rock Garden or Alpine Garden into the
more imposing Rock Garden of our present-day
language. It points to the bolder grouping&mdash;now
happily adopted in most good gardens and more in
accordance with Nature's pattern&mdash;which includes
evergreen and flowering shrubs as well as the close-growing
alpine plants, gem-like in their brilliant
colours, which in earlier days were alone considered
suitable for the purpose. The principle is now
generally recognised that the "unstudied picturesqueness
of Nature may be brought into the rule and
line ordering of our gardens," and the better construction
and government of the Rock Garden gives
greater scope for the carrying out of this worthy
effort.</p>

<p>In enumerating suitable shrubs for the Rock
Garden, more than ordinary care should be exercised
in their selection, in view of the greater difficulty
of rectifying mistakes in such positions. We must
not be led away by the beauty of a shrub, for
instance, during its time of flowering alone, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
considering its character at other seasons and its
adaptability to its special surroundings. A due sense
of proportion will also hold us back from planting
a spreading, hungry-natured shrub in limited space,
or where it would rob and over-run more valuable
but weaker plants. Such considerations as these
must be left to the planter who, in his turn, must
be guided by the incidental circumstances of his
particular locality. It is only possible here to set
down some of the best shrubs available for the
purpose, and to indicate, in a very general way, the
positions for which they are suitable.</p>

<p>Occasionally, where there is ample space, a deciduous
tree of low growth may be planted to great
advantage. Not long ago, in a picturesque district
bordering on Western Germany, a mental note was
made of the excellent effect of Wild Medlar trees,
scarcely more than good-sized bushes, growing about
the boulders and overhanging the edge of quarried
rocks. The white flowers in spring, and the fine
form and tint of the russet-brown fruit as it gradually
swells during the summer months, give this tree a
peculiar claim on our attention where the position
is suitable. But in planning the main features of
the Rock Garden, we naturally turn our thoughts
first to evergreen trees and shrubs, because the
plants grown in such positions, being usually either
alpine or herbaceous, are mostly in abeyance during
the winter, and it is desirable that the rockery, no
less than every other part of the garden, should
be interesting even if it cannot be gay, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
period of rest. A specimen Holly or, in exceptionally
mild climates, a tall bush, from 8 to 10 feet high,
of <i>Pittosporum undulatum</i>, one of the most beautiful
of New Zealand evergreen trees, may be so placed,
for example, as to be exceedingly pictorial; but, as
a rule, we must keep our shrubs to an average
maximum height of not more than from 4 to 5 feet,
and, generally speaking, those of still lower stature
are better suited to the ordinary Rock Garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 179px;"><a id="image0043" name="image0043" href="images/illus0203.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0203th.jpg" width="179" height="242" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">CISTUSES AND ROSES IN THE ROCK GARDEN.</p>

<p class="caption">(In the left lower corner, Cistus hirsutus; middle, Rosa alba; to right,
R. rugosa Mme. Georges Bruant.)]</p>

<p>Some of the small-growing Conifers, from their
compact habit and distinct character, are especially
well fitted to break the outline and to give contrast.
We think of Pines and Spruce Firs and Cedars as
majestic trees, and it is only when one comes to
study them in their manifold varieties that we find
how many of these range from a height of only a
few inches to 3 feet, or at most to 4 feet.</p>

<p>Some species, it is true, do not lend themselves
gracefully to the dwarfing process, becoming clumpy
and inelegant, but this charge cannot be brought
against many of the Cypresses and Junipers. Several
of the smaller Conifers, besides, give the advantage
of distinct variations of colour with the changing
seasons. Reference is not now made to the golden
and silver forms, so-called, which occur in most of
the genera, and put on their brightest tints in spring,
but to the deeper winter colouring assumed, <i>e.g.</i> by
the interesting <i>Retinospora ericoides</i>, which alters its
summer tone of dark green to purple brown on the
approach of cold weather; or by <i>Cryptomeria elegans</i>,
a little less hardy, which changes to a fine shade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
bronzy crimson. Like other plants, Conifers differ
greatly as to constitution, and judgment must be
used in their choice. The dwarf alpine form of the
Common Juniper (<i>Juniperus communis nana</i>) is very
hardy and slow-growing, never becoming too rampant
for the smallest Rock Garden, and shares the
blue-grey tint which is so characteristic of this beautiful
species. <i>J. c. alpina aurea</i> is a delightful small-growing
Conifer. In summer the foliage is light
yellow, and in winter heavily shaded with bronzy
yellow. Very distinct from it is the lovely prostrate
Savin (<i>J. Sabina procumbens</i>), one of the best
of evergreen shrubs for the Rock Garden, and one
most restful and satisfying to the eye at all times
in its deep tones of sea green. A first-rate variety
is <i>J. S. tamariscifolia</i>, which is of very spreading
growth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 179px;"><a id="image0044" name="image0044" href="images/illus0204.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0204th.jpg" width="179" height="242" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">DWARF SHRUBS ON ROCK GARDEN.</p>

<p><i>Cupressus pisifera</i>, almost plumose in one of its
many variations, and <i>C. obtusa</i>, both better known
perhaps under the garden name of Retinosporas, are
admirable, and may be used either in the normal or
the dwarf forms according to the greater or less
space at command. Almost the last tree, probably,
which one would expect to see draping the vertical
face of a rock is the Spruce Fir, yet a weeping variety
(<i>Picea excelsa pendula</i>) is exceedingly effective in such a
position as a foil to hanging masses of richly-coloured
Aubrietias or Golden Alyssum, while it looks well at
all seasons. Mention may here be made of a remarkable
Conifer, <i>Cunninghamia sinensis</i>, of great beauty
and very distinct character, which takes the shape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in our climate, of a spreading bush, though in its
native habitat it grows into a tree of noble dimensions.
It is suitable only for a Rock Garden of
some boldness of construction, and in gardens
favoured with a mild climate and a sheltered
position, but under such happy circumstances a
place should certainly be found for this handsome
and little-known China Fir.</p>

<p>Another uncommon coniferous shrub, also very
distinct and more generally useful than the last, is
<i>Podocarpus alpina</i>. Though a native of Tasmania, it
grows at high elevations, and is able to resist severe
frost. Dark green in foliage, only about 2 feet in
height, and of a somewhat spreading nature, it is
never out of place in the Rock Garden, whether large
or small.</p>

<p>From Conifers we may pass to Veronicas, certain
of which might almost be mistaken for some minute
form of Cypress. Of this character is a small
group known in New Zealand, the natural habitat of
a large number of shrubby species, by the apposite
name of Whipcord Veronicas. Being themselves
alpine, they are particularly well suited for grouping
with low-growing mountain plants. Six species or
varieties of this interesting section grow naturally at
elevations ranging from 7000 to 4000 feet, and are
much more hardy than is generally supposed. These
are: <i>V. cupressoides</i>, <i>V. c. var. variabilis</i>, <i>V. lycopodioides</i>,
<i>V. Armstrongii</i>, <i>V. Hectori</i>, <i>V. loganioides</i>.</p>

<p>The form of <i>V. cupressoides</i>, known as <i>variabilis</i>,
was mistaken, on its first introduction, for a distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
species, <i>V. salicornoides</i>, and may still be met with
under that name. The small violet or white flowers
of these miniature evergreen shrubs are not perhaps
much to be taken into account, but they have a
distinct value of their own as rock-work greenery.
There are other dwarf New Zealand Veronicas of
a leafy character, differing essentially from these
mimetic species, such as <i>V. carnosula</i> and <i>V. pinguifolia</i>,
also inhabiting regions 5000 feet above the
sea-level, which are suited for localities with average
advantages of climate. Others again, such as <i>V.
Lyallii</i>, <i>V. glauco-cærulea</i>, and <i>V. hulkeana</i>, though they
grow naturally at lower altitudes, and must be
reckoned only half-hardy, may yet be serviceable for
Rock Gardens on the southern sea-board, or on the
west coast of Scotland. Belonging to the larger-growing
and more familiar species of Shrubby Veronica,
mention may be made of a good purple-flowered
hybrid, of very compact growth, known as Purple
Queen, which is exceedingly ornamental from its free-flowering
habit. Many of the losses sustained amongst
these interesting New Zealand shrubs are owing to
drought rather than to frost, and their extreme susceptibility
to dryness at the root is a fact not recognised
as it should be.</p>

<p>Hardy Heaths are of the utmost value in the Rock
Garden, and range in height from the 6 feet or more
of <i>Erica arborea</i> to the 6 inches of the well-known
<i>E. carnea</i>, and can be used in rough places, where
more delicate plants might not thrive. A sudden
emergency once arose in the experience of the writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
when a shelving mass of earth had to be shored-up
as quickly as possible with such material as lay ready
to hand at the moment. This happened to be found
in a heap of ugly, yellowish, water-worn boulders of
great size, which abound in that particular locality,
at no great distance below the ground-level, and
must be dug out when any deep trenching has
to be done. There was no time to be wasted in
facing the stones, which would have made them
more sightly, and they had to be used as they were.
Fortunately a large consignment of the best hardy
Heaths had lately arrived from the Darley Dale
Nurseries, and were immediately seized upon to
cover up the ugliness of the hastily-built-up barricade.
Boulders and Heaths, however, took to each other
kindly, in spite of a soil by no means specially suitable,
and with the addition, later, of a few good
kinds of Cistus and other shrubs, the bank still
remains as happy a bit of rough planting as could
be desired.</p>

<p>Of the taller Heaths, <i>E. lusitanica</i> is somewhat tender,
and is not so generally useful as <i>E. mediterranea</i> or
<i>E. arborea</i> (Tree Heath). A hybrid form&mdash;<i>E. mediterranea
× E. carnea</i>&mdash;is excellent, and comes into
flower about Christmas, in advance of either of its
parents, when its pale-purple spikes are very welcome,
and are quite distinct from the rosy-red flowers of <i>E.
carnea</i>: it is known as <i>E. mediterranea hybrida</i>. The
foliage of hardy Heaths is never unsightly, but the
persistent dead flowers are, and these should always
be clipped off as soon as their beauty is over, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
new growth will break away above the withered
flowers, leaving, in many cases, straggling and unclothed
branches. The omission of this needful
work every season is a fruitful source of the raggedness
which brings some discredit on these otherwise
attractive plants.</p>

<p>Many flowering shrubs of the same natural order
as Heaths, but unlike them in general appearance,
such as the Alpine Rhododendrons, <i>R. ferrugineum</i>
and <i>R. hirsutum</i>, and the less well-known but very
beautiful and distinct <i>R. racemosum</i>, as well as some
of the miniature varieties of <i>Azalea indica</i>, notably
<i>R. obtusa</i> and its forms, seem peculiarly suitable for
the Rock Garden (see p. <a href="#Page_428">428</a> for lists of the best
Rhododendrons). Again, where rock meets more
level ground, and the trickle of a stream can be so
directed as to give moisture without sogginess, a
considerable number of peat-loving evergreen shrubs
belonging to the same order, of the type of <i>Gaultheria</i>,
<i>Vaccinium</i>, and <i>Pieris</i>, may be used with excellent
effect. <i>Gaultheria Shallon</i>, indeed, is a singularly fine
shrub in any position, and is not very exacting in
any of its requirements. Growing about 2 feet high,
with purple leaf-tints in winter, and spikes of white
waxy flowers, brightly tinged with red, in spring,
which are followed by purple fruit, few things can
surpass it in its way. For carpeting moist spots, the
little <i>G. procumbens</i>, which rises scarcely 3 inches
from the ground, will fill a useful place with its
winter colouring of crimson brown. Shrubs of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
class are well worth study by those whose locality
admits of their cultivation.</p>

<p>For dry, sunny, and stony banks Rock Roses may
be chosen, but the position must be wind-screened,
a more important factor in the question of their
hardiness than cold. The large-growing Gum Cistus
is well known and tolerably hardy everywhere, and
so also is <i>C. laurifolius</i>, but there are several most
desirable species of dwarfer growth, such as the
white, crimson-spotted <i>C. lusitanicus</i>, the pink-flowered
<i>C. villosus</i>, the bright-red <i>C. crispus</i>, and the pure
white <i>C. florentinus</i>, which are quite happy in sheltered
rock walks especially by the sea; they have been
also grown with success in many colder situations
inland. The Cistineæ, at best, are somewhat short-lived,
and lose vigour and power of resistance as
they grow older. Keep up, therefore, young, thrifty
stock by yearly cuttings to fill up inevitable gaps,
which is a matter of no cultural difficulty. Where
Rock Roses are out of the question, their place may
worthily be filled by the hardier shrubby <i>Helianthemums</i>,
though they differ greatly from Cistineæ
in their trailing habit and smaller flowers. The
breadths of brilliant colour given by these Sun Roses
while in bloom are invaluable, and may be enjoyed
to the full in almost any locality, while the
many variations of tint, from deep green to ashen
grey, in their leafage should also be taken into consideration,
as it increases their usefulness when out
of flower.</p>

<p>No list of good shrubs for the Rock Garden would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
be complete without some reference to <i>Yuccas</i>, which
for all practical purposes must be included under
that head. Groups of these magnificent plants, with
their sub-tropical effect, cannot be surpassed for
nobility of outline and stateliness of flower. To do
them full justice, they must have space to develop
their grand proportions, but this may often be found
on the ridge or upper slope, even in rock-work of
limited character. <i>Y. gloriosa</i>, with its fine form,
<i>Y. recurva</i>, and the stemless <i>Y. flaccida</i>, of smaller
growth, are amongst the best and hardiest kinds,
and to these may be added <i>Y. angustifolia</i>, another
valuable and nearly stemless species.</p>

<p>It is only possible, in restricted space, to touch
in a very cursory way upon a few of the available
groups of dwarf-growing shrubs. Many more than
have been mentioned will occur readily to the minds
of those who are at all conversant with plants, such
as <i>Abelia rupestris</i>, <i>Magnolia stellata</i>, several beautiful
species of <i>Daphne</i>, some of the St. John's Worts, of
low-growing <i>Cytisus</i>, and others which may be classed
under the head of miscellaneous. The subjoined
list, though it does not pretend to be exhaustive,
will be found of use, either for purposes of winter
greenery or for summer embellishment, by those
who are seeking good and suitable dwarf shrubs
for planting, under varied conditions in the Rock
Garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="gap2">REMOVAL OF LARGE TREES AND SHRUBS</h3>


<p>Probably no garden operation requires more time
and labour than the proper removal of large trees
and shrubs from one part of a garden to another.
Time, as it will take two, or even three, days to
remove a large tree to a distance; and labour, as the
services of from eight to twelve men will be required
to accomplish the work. It is not, therefore, an
operation to be lightly undertaken or got through
in a hurry.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the various ways of
moving large specimen plants, it will be well to consider
the trees and shrubs that are generally required
to be moved. Three numbered lists are given
arranged according to the roots of the shrubs or
trees&mdash;that is, those that, when they have stood for
some time in one place, are most alike as regards
the way their roots are placed together; and the lists
are also some guide when transplanting, as the
chances of life after removal are greatest in No. 1,
less in No. 2, and considerably lower in No. 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be noticed that Conifers are mentioned in
the third list, and even in nurseries where they are
regularly moved the mortality amongst them is very
high; and the removal of large Conifers should never
be attempted except with a transplanting machine,
and expert men to handle it. As a rule, it will be
found cheaper and better to buy young plants than
to attempt the removal of large ones that have stood
for some years without root disturbance. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
flowering shrubs as <i>Spiræa</i>, <i>Philadelphus</i>, <i>Kerria</i>, <i>Ribes</i>,
&amp;c., can be safely moved without much trouble, as
they make a mass of roots which will hold a good
ball of soil unless it is very dry. All are practically
certain to live if carefully planted and well watered
afterwards.</p>

<p>There are several ways of moving large trees, the
simplest and quickest being by a proper transplanting
machine, which consists of a framework on
wheels fitted with a system of rollers and levers.
For moderately-sized trees, say, to about 12 feet
high, a two-wheeled machine is sufficient. This is
moved by eight or ten men. For trees above 12
feet high a four-wheeled machine is required, with
two, or perhaps three, horses to draw it. The first
will take a ball of soil weighing from two to three
tons, the latter anything to ten tons, or even more.</p>

<p>In preparing the tree for the small machine the
ball is made round, and slightly smaller than the
width of the machine, a trench being cut round the
tree to a depth of 3 feet or so, the actual depth
depending on the roots, but the soil should be removed
a foot lower than the lowest roots. On no
account undermine the ball until the proper depth
has been reached. A proper machine-pick is the best
thing to use under the ball, carefully working out
sufficient soil to introduce a board 6 inches wide and
about 1&frac12; inches thick on each side of the ball. The
soil immediately under the centre of the ball should
be left intact. When the boards are in position
ropes are passed under them on each side and led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
up over the rollers on the machine and fastened, and
then by levers the ropes are rolled up, swinging the
plant up cleanly and with a good ball of soil. Before
putting the ropes under, however, a stout piece of
canvas or mat should be tied round the ball with a
couple of cords, between which and the canvas seven
or eight pieces of narrow flat board should be fixed
to prevent the cords from cutting the ball. The rear
part of the machine is made to be taken out so that
it can be pushed right over a plant, and it should
be run on planks on soft ground.</p>

<p>With the large transplanting machine a ball of soil
of almost any size can be taken, but the method of
preparing it is somewhat different. It should be
made nearly square, being rather longer than it is
broad. When the proper depth has been reached
make a hole about 2 feet wide under the centre of
the ball, and running entirely through the longer
way of it. Through this hole one, or even two,
broad planks 3 inches thick should be passed. On
each end of these, where they project beyond the
ball, a stout plank is laid on edge, and two others
placed lengthwise to fit above the first two. These
planks should all be cut to fit tightly into each other.
If necessary, owing to the depth of the ball, another
tier of planks should be placed above the first to
insure stability. The machine is then placed over
the plant, and the whole, by means of chains and
levers, is swung up off the ground, and then ready to
be taken anywhere. This machine, however, should
only be used by those who have had experience with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
it, as it is difficult and cumbersome to handle, and
in the hands of novices is liable to cause serious
accidents.</p>

<p>Where no transplanting machine exists, other
mechanical contrivances must be used to move a
large tree. Rollers and planks, a low trolley, or a
draw-board, as it is called, are the best. The
preparation for removal is the same for these means
as it is for a machine, with the exception of getting
under it, which varies according to the means employed.
For rollers and planks the soil should be
worked out directly under the centre of the ball, and
planks put through to form a bed to run the shrub
or tree on. On these a roller should be placed,
working the soil out at the sides so that it is well
under the ball, but not going so far under as to
undermine it, and cause it to drop over. Above the
roller put one wide plank to form the bottom of the
ball, and by means of a rope round it the whole can
be taken where required. When moving it, however,
it is well to raise the rear half by means of a broad
lever or a lifting-jack, which, in conjunction with a
steady pull on the rope, should start the plant comfortably
on its journey.</p>

<p>When a low trolley is used the ball of soil must
be firm, and not liable to break to pieces when
handled with reasonable care. Having cut out the
ball to the required depth, work under it all round,
merely leaving enough in the centre to support it. If
possible, work off some of the upper soil to decrease
the weight, but this depends entirely upon the roots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and the way they run. If small roots are plentiful
at the top, little or no soil can be removed, but if
they are lower down, then the upper soil may be
removed with advantage. Having worked under the
ball, lay two stout planks under it well packed up to
the centre, and then with two strong poles under the
ends of the planks lift the whole on the trolley. If
the work is carefully thought out, it is possible to
make the actual lifting a very small operation by
bringing the trolley close and lowering it considerably.</p>

<p>The draw-board is a handy contrivance for
moderate-sized trees or shrubs which will hold a
good ball of soil. It is made in two forms. One
consists of a piece of well-seasoned oak 3 inches
thick, and about 3 feet long by 2 to 2&frac12; feet wide
at the widest part, from which it slopes down to
a thick end, where a stout swivel-ring is fixed to
take a rope. The other form is a kind of trolley,
and consists of a frame 3 feet long by 2 feet wide;
it runs on rollers that work on bent irons fastened
to the framework, the whole standing about 4 inches
high. Either of these can be used for moving
plants the ball of soil attached to which is not larger
than the board. They will take a heavy plant with
comparative ease, and are especially useful for moving
large Rhododendrons and other American shrubs.
To get them under a plant cut out the ball of soil
to the proper depth, and work under it from the
front, that is, the direction in which the plant is to
go, keeping the ball wedged up during the process,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
<i>not</i> by having a man to pull the top over, but by
using wedges or levers underneath it, until sufficient
soil has been worked out to allow the board to be
inserted. When the board is in position the rope
should be passed through the ring and then around
the collar, using a piece of mat to keep it from
rubbing the bark off, and then back through the ring
again. It is well to run the board over planks on
soft ground to reduce the labour of pulling.</p>

<p>In putting the tree or shrub into its new position,
carefully measure the size of the ball, and make the
hole considerably larger and slightly deeper, breaking
up the bottom well. When the tree or shrub
is in position ram the soil tightly round it until it
is about two-thirds covered, when the hole should
be completely filled with water, covering in the
remainder when the water has drained away. The
stem must also be made secure by means of stakes
or cords, otherwise wind will cause damage to the
roots.</p>

<p>When the ground is dry under a tree that is to
be moved nothing should be done until it has been
thoroughly soaked. To do this a trench 2 feet
deep and as narrow as possible should be taken out
all round, and gradually filled in with water, pouring
it in steadily, away from the ball rather than to it,
and persevere with this watering till the ball of soil
under the tree is thoroughly saturated. Leave it for
at least twenty-four hours to drain. Three points
must not be forgotten: (1) Wrap the ball of soil
securely round with canvas as soon as possible; (2)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
never use the stem of a tree as a lever in moving
the ball&mdash;this should always be moved from below,
and the stem never touched on any account; (3)
always allow plenty of room for working.</p>

<p>Moving large trees is not easy and must not be
lightly undertaken. It involves much time, labour,
and expense, in most cases far more than the trees
are worth. Trees 8 or 10 feet high may be easily
moved, but above that height the work should be
done by an expert. Trees and shrubs of considerable
size can be purchased at a moderate price from
good tree nurseries, where they have been regularly
transplanted, and if carefully planted will soon make
good specimens.</p>

<p>It is in the planting of trees that so many failures
occur as a rule. A good tree may be obtained, arrive
in excellent condition, and yet be planted in such
a way that success is out of the question. The fault,
as a matter of course, is put on the man who supplied
the tree, not on the one who killed it by
improper planting. Those who think of moving
large trees or shrubs should not do so until the
probable cost has been considered, and the advice
and help obtained of some one who has handled
big trees before. The expert will be able to say if
a tree can bear removal, or whether it is better
destroyed, and its place filled with a young and
vigorous specimen from a nursery.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">YOUNG TREES AND SUNSTROKE</h3>


<p>It is most noticeable that the stems of young trees
of from 8 to about 14 feet in height are apt in
some seasons to get much damaged, so much so
that the trees are rarely satisfactory for some years
afterwards, even if they do not die outright. The
mischief is usually not seen until it is too late to
mend matters, and is found more as a rule on young
trees with small heads standing out singly than
where they are planted amongst undergrowth or
in partial shade. If careful notice is taken it will
be found that the stems are damaged on the south
side, or it may be east or west of south, but never
on the north side, and this is directly caused by the
rays of the sun being too hot for the young stems to
bear. The trees most liable to sunstroke&mdash;which
it practically amounts to&mdash;are the Lime, Willow,
Horse Chestnut, Sweet Chestnut, Birch, Mountain
Ash, Ash, and Plane, and generally in the order
they are given, the softer wooded trees suffering
more severely than those of harder growth. The
Oak, Elm, and Beech are seldom much damaged
by the sun, though in cases of failure it will be well
to notice the stems and see how far the direct rays
of the sun are responsible for the death of the tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The first marks of sunstroke are seen in the shape
of longitudinal cracks in the bark, which is also
slightly browned and flattened, as if there were a
hollow beneath. The part affected is from about
1 to 3 feet in length, and from 1 to 3 inches
in width. If the bark is cut away the wood
beneath will be found perfectly firm, but hard and
dry, more like a piece of seasoned wood than part
of a growing tree. When such is the case the only
thing that can be done is to cut away the bark
back to the living tissue, thoroughly coat the wound
with gas tar, and shade the stem afterwards with a
few branches or something that does not need to be
fastened on the stem. Hay or straw bands cannot
be altogether recommended, as anything which
excludes the light tends to the softening of the
young bark. This should be avoided, as the firmer
the bark the better will be the ultimate success of
the tree. Iron tree-guards, though not beautiful,
have the advantage of protecting the stems of young
trees from the sun as well as from the attacks of
animals. In addition to the slight shade they give,
the iron, being a good conductor of heat, takes up a
large amount of the heat rays which would otherwise
be directed full upon the stem.</p>

<p>A hot and dry season is no more likely to cause
sunstroke than a wet one, and probably not so
much, as we have noticed it in sunless years quite
as much as in bright summers. The time when
it is most likely to happen is when a few days of
hot sunshine follow a spell of wet weather, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
wood is then soft and full of moisture, and is more
liable to be scorched than during a period of
prolonged sunshine.</p>

<p>When trees are planted out singly it is well to
choose those with spreading heads and low stems,
as then the tree will shade itself to a great extent,
the short amount of bare stem being less exposed to
the sun's rays than a taller one. After all, this is
only Nature's method of protection, as, in a wild
state, no young tree is bare-stemmed, except in a
wood, where it is shaded by those near it. On the
edge of a wood, or in the open, young trees are
furnished to the ground with foliage, which is not
shed until the stem has become hardened enough to
withstand climatic vicissitudes. If trees with tall
stems are the only ones available, then the stems
should be shaded by some means for a year or two,
especially when they have become established and
are making strong, sappy growths, as the stem is
practically in the same condition and apt to be
scorched by a sudden burst of hot sunshine.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Goat and Wood-Leopard Moths</h3>

<p>Sunstroke must not be confounded with the
ravages of the caterpillars of the Goat Moth and
Wood-Leopard Moth, the external signs of which
are much the same, but on the bark being removed
one or two channels almost the size of a man's
little finger are to be seen, together with accumulations
of wet sawdust-like material deposited by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
caterpillar. These are exterminated by thrusting a
stout wire into the channels until the grub is killed,
and afterwards cutting away the dead bark and
tarring the wound thoroughly. The tree should
also be securely staked, otherwise it will probably
snap off in the first high wind.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">SHADE TREES FOR STREETS</h3>


<p>In the middle ages it was accounted an act of piety
to make or maintain a road or a bridge, or to do
anything in connexion with them that would conduce
to the safety or comfort of the wayfarer. The
planting of trees for shade, or the placing of a
shaded bench for rest came within the same category
of pious works. In our days, when rush and hurry
and the pressure of business, and the worship of
bare utility fill the minds of most men, there are
many who have almost forgotten the gracious aspects
of the more leisurely life. It is probably from this
cause that so many opportunities are lost that might
be seized by those in authority for making the
lives of our fellow-creatures somewhat easier and
pleasanter.</p>

<p>In days of extreme heat what a difference in
comfort there would be between the bare sun-baked
expanses of the streets of many a town, such as we
all know, and the same spaces carefully planted with
shade-giving trees! In very narrow streets trees are,
of course, out of the question, or in any street
whose width is not enough to allow of easy traffic
and trees as well, but one cannot walk through any
town, except the very few in which the question has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
already been considered and satisfactorily answered,
without seeing many a street or waste space or
corner where a row or a group or even a single
tree would not add immensely to both beauty and
comfort. Where there is plenty of width, and especially
where houses fall back a little from the road,
the trees may well stand just within the edge of the
footpath or pavement. Should there be still more
width, there may be a row in the middle of the
road. In this case the middle row of trees should
not be quite evenly continuous, but perhaps five or
six trees and then a gap, formed by leaving out one
tree, in order to allow the traffic to move from side
to side of the road. In many a town where a street
runs north-east and south-west, a row of trees on
its south-western side only might be an inestimable
boon.</p>

<p>Even in country villages there is often a bare
place, especially where roads meet, where a few
trees well planted and a plain strong oak bench
would be a comfort and a pleasure to many hardworking
folk, and might be the means of converting
unsightliness into beauty.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">PLANE TREE (Platanus orientalis).</p>

<p>For towns the Plane has the best character, but
other good trees are Wych Elm and Hornbeam,
Sycamore, Maple, Lime, Lombardy Poplar, and
Horse Chestnut. The spreading growth of the
Horse Chestnut commends it rather for a space
like the <i>place</i> of a foreign town. Here is also the
place for Limes, for though they are good street
trees, yet when in bloom the strong, sweet scent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
although a passing whiff is delicious, might be an
annoyance if poured continuously into the windows
of houses during the blooming time.</p>

<p>The Wild Cherry, with its quantity of early bloom,
would be a beautiful street tree, and in places where
trees of rather smaller growth are desired there is
the Bird Cherry and the Mountain Ash. The large
American Mountain Ash is a good street tree, in
autumn loaded with its handsome bunches of scarlet
fruit.</p>

<p>The larger Willows are also charming trees for
streets. Many of the trees named, if their tops
spread too near the houses, may, with good effect,
be pollarded about 10 feet from the ground.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS IN SCOTLAND</h3>


<p>The following list has been kindly sent me by a
great lover of trees and shrubs who lives at Forres.
My correspondent writes: "I have grown all the
plants in my list in my own garden, except <i>Buddleia
globosa</i> and <i>Aralia chinensis</i>, but the latter is grown
in quantity by several of my neighbours, and there
are also several fine plants of the Buddleia in
many gardens in sheltered spots. My experience is
that many plants are quite frost-proof but cannot
stand cold winds. This applies more especially to
the shrubby Veronicas. I have seen them in the
Edinburgh Botanic Gardens as if scorched with fire
on the exposed side, while they were untouched
where sheltered from the north and east. My own
garden is fairly well sheltered."</p>

<p><i>Amelanchier canadensis.</i>&mdash;Hardy, free-flowering,
beautiful at all times.</p>

<p><i>Aralia chinensis (Dimorphanthus) mandschurica.</i>&mdash;Useful
in some positions for its curious habit of
growth and rather handsome foliage; quite hardy.</p>

<p><i>Aristolochia Sipho.</i>&mdash;This has curious and inconspicuous
flowers, which give this climbing plant its
popular name of "Dutchman's Pipe." It can be
grown on a wall, in which position, perhaps, its fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
foliage is seen to the best advantage, but it is quite
hardy and looks well climbing into a thin tree such
as the Common Almond.</p>

<p><i>Berberis (Mahonia) Aquifolium.</i>&mdash;A handsome plant at
all times, and will even grow under the shade of trees.</p>

<p><i>Berberis Darwinii.</i>&mdash;Very bright in flower. Young
and sappy shoots get killed back in winter.</p>

<p><i>Berberis Thunbergi.</i>&mdash;A most attractive Berberis;
it makes a small neat-growing bush to which the
adjective "sparkling" might be applied. Its chief
glory is its autumnal foliage, and a large clump in
September is "a sight to see"; quite hardy.</p>

<p><i>Berberis vulgaris.</i>&mdash;Very beautiful when clustered
with fruit. The purple-leaved variety (<i>B. v. purpurea</i>)
is most useful for its foliage.</p>

<p><i>Betula alba purpurea.</i>&mdash;A good foliage tree.</p>

<p><i>Buddleia globosa.</i>&mdash;This does well in a warm
sheltered spot facing south-west, where the morning
sun in winter will not touch it too soon. It also
objects to exposure to cold winds.</p>

<p><i>Calycanthus floridus.</i>&mdash;Quite hardy, and grows well
in half-shady places.</p>

<p><i>Ceanothus azureus.</i>&mdash;This succeeds either trained to
a wall or as a bush. In the latter case it should be
in a sheltered position. It seems quite frost-proof,
and its blue flowers are very beautiful at a time
when few shrubs are in bloom (July and August).
Its shoots should be well thinned, and those left
shortened as soon as the buds begin to show signs
of movement in the spring. The best form I have
tried is Gloire de Versailles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Choisya ternata</i> (Mexican Orange Flower).&mdash;This is
well worth growing as a bush in a sheltered angle
of a wall, where it can be protected in winter with
a hurdle or some such contrivance, lightly thatched
with Broom. It is even then, in very severe weather,
cut about the points of the shoots, which, of course,
spoils the blooming; but it soon grows through again,
and it is worth growing for its foliage alone.</p>

<p><i>Clematis.</i>&mdash;These mostly do well, and the newer
sorts are very attractive, but for all purposes it is
very hard to beat <i>C. montana</i> and <i>C. Jackmani</i>, the
former in May and the latter for the autumn.</p>

<p><i>Clethra alnifolia.</i>&mdash;A neat and free-flowering shrub,
with spikes of white flowers in August; it is very hardy
and useful, as few shrubs are in flower at that time.</p>

<p><i>Cornus alba.</i>&mdash;A clump of this Dogwood is very
effective in winter, especially when the sun is shining
on its bright-red shoots. <i>C. a. Spaethii</i> is a good variegated
variety.</p>

<p><i>Corylus Avellana purpurea.</i>&mdash;A good purple-leaved
nut.</p>

<p><i>Cotoneaster microphylla.</i>&mdash;Quite hardy either as a
bush or on a wall.</p>

<p><i>Cytisus albus.</i>&mdash;No garden should be without this
beautiful Broom. <i>C. præcox</i>, the Cream Broom, is a
dwarfer but no less beautiful variety; it is very
pretty grouped with a few plants of <i>C. purpureus</i>,
which flowers at the same time. Another fine Broom
is the red and yellow variety of the Common Broom
(<i>C. scoparius andreanus</i>). The Brooms will grow anywhere,
but prefer an open place in full sun. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
should be cut hard back after flowering, and if the
young seed-pods can be picked off so much the
better.</p>

<p><i>Daphne Cneorum.</i>&mdash;A bright little shrub best grown
on the rock garden; quite hardy.</p>

<p><i>Daphne Laureola.</i>&mdash;This has fine foliage and will
grow in quite a shady place.</p>

<p><i>Daphne Mezereum.</i>&mdash;A beautiful early-flowering
Daphne, too well known for description.</p>

<p><i>Deutzia crenata.</i>&mdash;A most useful hardy shrub, growing
to a good size. The variety, Pride of Rochester,
is very pretty.</p>

<p><i>Diervilla (Weigela).</i>&mdash;Indispensable shrubs, very
hardy, free-flowering, and easily grown. The flowering
shoots should be cut back to strong young wood
as soon as the flowers fade. They are most accommodating
in this respect, as the strongest of the
young shoots start well back and not at the points,
as is usual with most plants. Good varieties are
Eva Rathke, <i>Hortensis nivea</i>, and <i>rosea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Escallonia macrantha.</i>&mdash;A good wall shrub.</p>

<p><i>Escallonia philippiana.</i>&mdash;Hardier than <i>E. macrantha</i>,
and can be grown as a bush in a sheltered spot.</p>

<p><i>Forsythia suspensa.</i>&mdash;Quite hardy, and very beautiful
in early spring, as it flowers before the leaf-buds
burst. It should be cut back to young growths after
the flower is over.</p>

<p><i>Fuchsia Riccartoni.</i>&mdash;This gets cut down every
winter, but is never killed, and it flowers abundantly
every year treated as a hardy herbaceous plant.</p>

<p><i>Garrya elliptica.</i>&mdash;Quite hardy as a bush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Genista tinctoria fl. pl.</i>&mdash;A low-growing trailing
Genista, useful for the rock garden and flowering when
many of the alpines are over.</p>

<p><i>Genista virgata.</i>&mdash;A very different plant from the
above, and will make a very large bush, covered
with pale-yellow flowers in late summer. A good
shrub.</p>

<p><i>Halesia tetraptera.</i>&mdash;Quite hardy and attractive both
in bloom and foliage.</p>

<p><i>Hamamelis arborea.</i>&mdash;This is quite hardy, but grows
very slowly. It flowers in a small state, but not very
freely. I have only had this plant for four years, but
I think it will do very well, and should flower more
freely when a bit larger.</p>

<p><i>Hedysarum multijugum.</i>&mdash;Quite hardy. An attractive
shrub, with spikes of reddish pea-like flowers in July
and August. It increases freely from the root by
suckers. Thin and cut back the shoots in spring.</p>

<p><i>Helianthemum vulgare</i> (Rock Rose).&mdash;There are
many garden varieties of this, both double and single,
the single sorts being the most attractive. They are
quite hardy on a warm and sunny rock garden.</p>

<p><i>Hydrangea paniculata.</i>&mdash;Hardy. A splendid low-growing
shrub, flowering in autumn. A group of
this, with a few plants of <i>Prunus Pissardi</i> cut hard
back every spring to keep them small, is very effective,
and the group can be carpeted with Lily of the
Valley or London Pride to cover the bare soil underneath.
The shoots of the Hydrangea should be well
thinned, and those left cut hard back in the spring.
It well repays a dose or two of liquid manure in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
growing season. The variety, <i>grandiflora</i>, is better
than the type.</p>

<p><i>Hypericum calycinum</i> (Rose of Sharon).&mdash;Grows
well in half shade. It is a dwarf plant, very pretty,
but perhaps too often seen. Useful for carpeting
other shrubs.</p>

<p><i>Jasminum nudiflorum.</i>&mdash;Best on a wall. Winter
flowering (yellow) and very pretty when in bloom.</p>

<p><i>Jasminum officinale.</i>&mdash;Requires a wall, but does
well while young. It is not a very long-lived plant
here.</p>

<p><i>Kalmia latifolia.</i>&mdash;Very attractive pink flowers;
hardy, and will do wherever Rhododendrons
flourish.</p>

<p><i>Kerria japonica.</i>&mdash;A pretty yellow-flowered shrub
that increases rapidly from the root. The double-flowered
variety is the most commonly grown.</p>

<p><i>Laburnum.</i>&mdash;Too well known for description. <i>L.
Adami</i> is curious and worth growing.</p>

<p><i>Lavendula Spica.</i>&mdash;The Lavender needs no description.</p>

<p><i>Leycesteria formosa.</i>&mdash;A good plant for a shady
place. It grows well under trees, and is very hardy.</p>

<p><i>Ligustrum ovalifolium</i> (Privet).&mdash;The golden form
of this is good and bright.</p>

<p><i>Liriodendron tulipifera.</i>&mdash;Grows well here, and is
quite hardy, but seldom flowers so far north.</p>

<p><i>Lonicera periclymenum.</i>&mdash;The common native
Honeysuckle is an indispensable climber, and will
grow almost anywhere; but looks best, perhaps, climbing
up trees, or over shrubs or hedges. The variety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<i>serotina</i>, flowers later than the type, and is best known
under the name of Late Dutch. <i>L. Sullivantii</i> is a
shrubby sort, with not unattractive flowers of a
brownish-orange colour.</p>

<p><i>Magnolia.</i>&mdash;The only one I have tried is <i>M. stellata</i>,
which has proved quite hardy, and I have no doubt
that several others would do quite as well in sheltered
places.</p>

<p><i>Neillia opulifolia</i> (<i>Spiræa opulifolia</i>).&mdash;Quite hardy.</p>

<p><i>Pernettya mucronata.</i>&mdash;Does well.</p>

<p><i>Pieris</i> (<i>Andromeda</i>) <i>floribunda</i>.&mdash;Is quite hardy and
very beautiful early in the year. Will grow in soils
that suit Rhododendrons.</p>

<p><i>Potentilla fruticosa.</i>&mdash;A little summer-flowering
shrub, with yellow flowers. It does well on the
upper parts of the rock garden, and is quite hardy.</p>

<p><i>Prunus</i> (<i>Cerasus</i>) <i>Mahaleb pendula</i>.&mdash;A very attractive
little weeping tree, with small white flowers in spring.</p>

<p><i>Pyrus.</i>&mdash;The following do well here: <i>Pyrus
floribunda</i>, <i>P. coronaria</i>, <i>P. lobata</i> (syn. <i>Mespilus grandiflora</i>),
and, of course, the native Rowan tree (<i>P.
Aucuparia</i>). The family of Apples enjoy a well-drained
place, being impatient of too much wet at
the roots; otherwise, their culture is of the simplest.
They should be allowed to grow as they will, only
cutting out any branches that would be obviously
better away, and dead wood if any.</p>

<p><i>Rhododendrons</i> and <i>Azaleas</i> luxuriate here. The
common <i>R. ponticum</i> sows itself in the woods. I
have not yet tried the Himalayan Rhododendrons,
but from what I have seen of them in the Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Botanic Gardens, which are much exposed to cold
winds, I feel fairly certain I could grow them here,
where I can give them more protection.</p>

<p><i>Rhodotypus kerrioides.</i>&mdash;A very pretty hardy shrub,
flowering on and off all the summer. It has very
clean white flowers, and from appearances looks as
though a cross with Kerria might be successful. The
Rhodotypus seeds freely here. It grows to a good size.</p>

<p><i>Rhus Cotinus.</i>&mdash;Another good shrub, attractive either
in flower or foliage, and the latter turns to a good
colour in autumn.</p>

<p><i>Ribes.</i>&mdash;No garden should be without a plant of
the Common Ribes. I also grow <i>Aureum</i> and a pale
pinkish-white sort.</p>

<p><i>Robinia hispida</i> (Rose Acacia).&mdash;This is doing well
in a corner sheltered from the north, east, and west
by evergreens.</p>

<p><i>Roses.</i>&mdash;The best that I grow as shrubs (in the
garden sense) are the Penzance Briars, <i>Rosa rugosa</i>
(Japanese Rose), Austrian Briars, <i>R. spinosissima</i>,
<i>Blairii II.</i>, Charles Lawson, <i>R. macrantha</i>, <i>R. alpina</i>,
&amp;c. These Roses stand up and make a good bush
in a sheltered place, without staking or any other
trouble. Very little pruning is needful, and that
after the flowers are over, cutting out weak wood
and shortening some of the old shoots back to where
young ones are breaking vigorously.</p>

<p><i>Rubus deliciosus.</i>&mdash;Very pretty white flowers, large
for a bramble. It appears to be quite hardy, but is
not a very strong grower.</p>

<p><i>Ruscus aculeatus</i> (Butcher's Broom).&mdash;An incon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>spicuous
little shrub that grows well under trees.</p>

<p><i>Spartium junceum</i> (Spanish Broom).&mdash;A good shrub
for a sheltered bank; it has spikes of bright-yellow
flowers in July.</p>

<p><i>Spiræa.</i>&mdash;Most of the Spiræas do well here. The
following are the best of those I grow: <i>S. canescens</i>,
very pretty habit of growth and foliage; <i>S. discolor</i>
(<i>ariæfolia</i>), <i>S. japonica</i> (vars. <i>alba</i>, <i>Bumalda</i>, and Anthony
Waterer), the last-mentioned very good. <i>S. lindleyana</i>,
a large grower, handsome both in flower and
foliage. <i>S. prunifolia fl. pl.</i> should be in all gardens;
good both for flowers and autumnal foliage. <i>S.
Van Houttei</i>, very good. <i>Exochorda grandiflora</i>, often
known as <i>Spiræa grandiflora</i>, I have had since 1898,
but though it is now a large bush and very healthy,
it has not yet made any attempt to flower.</p>

<p><i>Syringa</i> (Lilacs).&mdash;These are indispensable. Some
of the newer varieties are good, such as Charles X.,
rosy lilac; Marie Legraye, white; Souv. de L. Späth,
reddish; Mme. Lemoine, double white. These should
always be procured on their own roots. Grafted
plants seldom live long.</p>

<p><i>Veronica.</i>&mdash;Several of the shrubby Veronicas do
well. <i>V. Traversii</i> is the hardiest of all. In the Edinburgh
Botanic Gardens there is a good collection of
these.</p>

<p><i>Viburnum Opulus sterilis.</i>&mdash;This, the well-known
Snowball tree, and <i>V. Tinus</i> (<i>Laurustinus</i>), are the
only two I have grown. Both do well, and I fancy
<i>V. plicatum</i> and some others would do also. I shall
try them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vitis Coignetiæ.</i>&mdash;I have this growing up the outer
branches of a Spanish Chestnut. It does not grow
very fast, but is making steady progress. It appears
to be perfectly hardy, and its fine foliage turns to a
magnificent colour in autumn.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Trees and Shrubs in Edinburgh</h3>

<p>Trees and shrubs that will thrive near Edinburgh
will do so in almost any exposed city or town similarly
situated. Only those that have proved adaptable
to this windswept district have been included,
an asterisk being placed against the more beautiful
and interesting species and varieties that are happy
in cold and windy gardens.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Acers.</span>&mdash;<i>A. Pseudo-platanus</i> is the "Plane" of Scotland.
Old trees form features of great beauty. It
reaches a height of 60 to 70 feet, often less when
isolated. <i>A. P. var. flavo-marginatum</i>*.&mdash;The original
tree of this variety still remains at Corstorphine,
near Edinburgh. It is very effective in spring, but
the foliage becomes much duller during summer.
<i>A. P. purpureum.</i> <i>A. campestre</i> (Common Maple).
<i>A. circinatum</i>*.&mdash;This is the most beautifully-coloured
tree we have in autumn. <i>A. platanoides</i>* (Norway
Maple).&mdash;This is to be preferred to either the Sycamore
or Common Maple for planting in pleasure-grounds
and gardens. <i>A. dasycarpum.</i>* <i>A. palma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>tum</i>*.&mdash;The
varieties of this are excellent although
slow growing. <i>A. rubrum.</i> <i>A. pictum.</i> <i>A. opulifolium
obtusatum</i>*.&mdash;A bright tree in early spring with its
golden-green foliage and flowers. <i>A. saccharinum</i>
(Sugar Maple). <i>A. japonicum</i> and varieties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Actinidia Kolomikta.</span>&mdash;Climber; grows quickly
on south wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horse Chestnut</span> (<i>Æsculus Hippocastanum</i>) and
others: <i>carnea</i>, <i>Pavia</i>, <i>parviflora</i>, <i>flava</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ailantus glandulosa</span> (Tree of Heaven).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelanchier vulgaris</span> and <i>A. canadensis</i>.*&mdash;Very
ornamental. Seldom seen, but as free-growing
and flowering as the Hawthorn. The popular name
for these beautiful trees is Snowy Mespilus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aralia spinosa</span> and <i>A. chinensis</i>.*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arbutus Andrachne.</span>&mdash;Flowers in February and
March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arctostaphylos alpina.</span>&mdash;Plenty of this found
in north of Scotland, but somewhat difficult to
establish in gardens. <i>A. Uva-ursi.</i>&mdash;Freer in growth
than the preceding. Both species are low-creeping
shrubs suitable for planting with Heaths in peat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristolochia Sipho</span> (Dutchman's Pipe).&mdash;Large
effective climber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artemisia Abrotanum</span>, <i>arborescens</i>, and <i>tridentata</i>.*&mdash;Useful
shrubs of grey tone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aucuba japonica</span> and varieties.*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberis Aquifolium</span>,* <i>Darwinii</i>, <i>vulgaris</i>, <i>nepalensis</i>.
Single specimens of <i>B. Aquifolium</i>, the
Mahonia, become very ornamental with age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betula alba</span>* (the Silver Birch).&mdash;A very hardy
tree, beautiful both in summer and winter. The
pendulous variety is the best. Its branches are
proof against all winds. No tree is so well adapted
for planting close up to houses in the city, for it is
very graceful, and obscures little light. <i>B. utilis</i>,
<i>B. papyrifera</i>, <i>B. populifolia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Box</span>* and varieties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bryanthus empetriformis.</span>*&mdash;Very fine planted
in broad masses. <i>B. erectus</i>&mdash;Very beautiful in small
beds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calycanthus floridus.</span>&mdash;This is excellent on
walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camellias</span> only flower here on walls in the
open. They form large bushes in the grounds.
<i>Camellia Thea</i>, the tea-plant, is also perfectly hardy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carmichælia flagelliformis.</span>*&mdash;Very interesting,
and flowering with great freedom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpenteria californica.</span>*&mdash;A splendid plant
for south walls, large established specimens having
a profusion of large white flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpinus Betulus</span>* (Hornbeam) and varieties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caryopteris Mastacanthus.</span>&mdash;A good wall
plant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassiope fastigiata</span>* and <i>C. tetragona</i>.*&mdash;Both are
very choice subjects here and flower well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Castanea sativa</span>* (Sweet or Spanish Chestnut).&mdash;Ornamental,
but does not ripen fruit here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceanothus americanus</span> and <i>veitchianus</i>.*&mdash;Splendid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cercis Siliquastrum</span>* (Judas tree).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chimonanthus fragrans</span> (Winter-sweet).&mdash;Wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Choisya ternata</span> (Mexican Orange Flower).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cistus.</span>*&mdash;These are very fine, and flower for
months if somewhat sheltered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clematis.</span>&mdash;Of these very charming are <i>alpina</i>,*
<i>apiifolia</i>, <i>Flammula</i>,* <i>heracleæfolia</i>, <i>Vitalba</i>.*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colletia cruciata.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colutea arborescens</span> and <i>melanocalyx</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Convolvulus Cneorum.</span>*&mdash;Very pretty plant for
a south wall; silvery foliage and white flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornus</span> (Dogwood).&mdash;Of these, <i>alba</i> and varieties,
<i>Kousa</i>, <i>florida</i>, <i>sanguinea</i> (very ornamental in winter),
<i>Mas</i> and <i>m. variegata</i>* (a very choice, variegated shrub),
are the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corylopsis pauciflora</span> and <i>C. spicata</i>.&mdash;Both do
well on a south wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corylus</span> (nut) <span class="smcap">Avellana</span> <i>purpurea</i>.*&mdash;One of the
most effective shrubs if used carefully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotoneasters.</span>&mdash;Of these, <i>buxifolia</i>, <i>Simonsii</i>, <i>thymifolia</i>,*
<i>microphylla</i>,* <i>horizontalis</i>* (a species with
peculiar spreading flat branches, producing a fine
effect if grown on sloping banks), are the most noteworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hawthorn.</span>&mdash;<i>Cratægus</i> are valuable hardy trees,
flowering at the end of June to July; the scarlet
form is brilliant.</p>

are <i>Q. sessilifolia</i>,* and <i>Q. pedunculata</i>. These generally
thrive well and are amongst the most beautiful
of trees for large gardens. In poor soil and
windswept places the British Oaks do not grow
more than about 40 feet in height, but develop
into picturesque features. Their foliage here is of
a pleasing green when that of the Beech and Sycamore
is past its best. Very few acorns are produced.
<i>Q. Cerris</i>,* the Turkey Oak, and its variety
<i>laciniata</i>,* and <i>Q. lucombeana</i>,* are also beautiful trees.
We must also mention the Evergreen Oak (<i>Q. Ilex</i>),*

and its varieties are the principal ornamental
currants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robinia Pseudacacia.</span>*&mdash;An elegant foliage tree,
and usually the last to break into leaf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span>&mdash;Practically all the Tea and Hybrid Perpetual
Roses can be grown, if sheltered spots are
chosen and the plants grown as dwarfs. However,
the stronger varieties are the most satisfactory ones,
and in bad seasons it is July before they commence
to flower, although September has well advanced
before they cease. The hybrid Sweet Briars are the
freest of all to grow. Groups form thickets of
foliage which are almost hidden with blossom.
<i>Rosa wichuraiana</i> covers banks, or anything somewhat
flat, in a very short time. It flowers through September,
and attracts great attention. Such tender
Roses as Maréchal Niel, Niphetos, and Banksian
are useless.</p>

very fine for drooping over rocks in rock garden;
<i>V. Vitis-idæa</i> and the variety <i>variegata</i>, a pretty
variety of this native shrub.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Veronica.</span>&mdash;Of these the most satisfactory are

They also happily include many of the best. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>

they are, however, best lifted early in October and
housed till May, or they may be covered in severe
weather. Cold winds do most mischief.</p>

<p class="caption">WYCH ELMS BY HEDGEROW.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conifers.</span>&mdash;These are only useful when young&mdash;at
least, the majority of them. It is impossible to
keep them symmetrical against strong cold winds,
and the deposits of soot upon their foliage are
injurious.</p>

<p>When Conifers are wished for as large trees, the
Cedar of Lebanon, Atlantic Cedar, <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>,
<i>Pinus Pinaster</i>, or <i>Cupressus lawsoniana</i> are suitable.</p>

<p>When Abies and Picea lose their symmetry they
are usually far from ornamental. All the species and
beautiful varieties of Cupressus, Thuya, and Juniperus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
are very valuable in a young state. They should be
replaced as they become thin and shabby, as they
soon do in exposed places. The most satisfactory
tree of all is the Yew. Even this hardy tree has
its foliage badly hurt by severe winds, but the
damage is soon made good.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TENDER SHRUBS AND TREES IN THE
SOUTH-WEST<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17" href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h3>


<p>The possibilities that exist of the successful open-air
culture of tender subjects in the south-west are
but little dreamt of by the majority of English flower-lovers.
They doubtless read with interest the accounts
in the horticultural press of Australian, Chilian, and
Californian flowering trees and shrubs growing in
their native habitats, and possibly feel a desire to
visit these climes in order that they may verify
with their own eyes the truth of their readings. As
a matter of fact, however, a lengthy sea-voyage is by
no means indispensable in order to view certain of
these exotics flourishing in the open air, for a few
hours' journey by rail will bring the passenger to a
land where many of these denizens of other climes
may be seen enjoying robust health under English
skies.</p>

<p>The following list of tender shrubs and trees
growing in the gardens of the south-west cannot claim
to be an exhaustive one, since it contains only such
as have been personally noticed in good health during
rambles along the southern coast-line of Cornwall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
and Devon, and, where no lengthened inspection is
possible, it is obvious that certain species and
varieties must be overlooked. Incomplete, however,
as it doubtless is, it should give an idea of the
climatic advantages enjoyed by the district in
question.</p>

<p>Many of the subjects mentioned are growing in
Tresco Abbey gardens, Isles of Scilly, but most of
these are also found in mainland gardens as well.
Where any have been met with at Tresco only, the
fact is noted, but these may also be present on the
mainland.</p>

<p>The soil of the Scillies, which is composed
apparently of peat and disintegrated granite, and is
almost identical with much of that around Penzance,
is admirably adapted for hard-wooded Australian,
New Zealand, and Chilian shrubs and trees, and
almost all the species and genera enumerated would
be best suited by a compost in which peat and leaf-mould
and granite sand formed the chief proportion,
although it must be allowed that some alluded to
have been found to succeed equally well in sandy
loam. Porosity in the soil is indispensable, for, in
this district, where the winter rains are often exceptionally
heavy, unless the water percolates rapidly
through the ground, stagnant moisture collects around
the roots, a condition which is absolutely fatal to
success. The advantages of the Cornish granite
sand are gradually being appreciated. Mr. Fitzherbert
writes, "I was told the other day by an
acquaintance that since he had imported it by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
truck-load to his Sussex garden he was able to grow
many things successfully that he had before failed
with."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abelia floribunda.</span>&mdash;Mexico. A beautiful evergreen
shrub, bearing clusters of drooping pink
flowers about 3 inches in length. Requires a sunny
and sheltered site. Finest specimen 6 feet. Several
gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abutilon vexillarium.</span>&mdash;Rio Grande. A handsome
evergreen species generally grown against a
wall. It throws up long, slender, arching shoots
from 6 to 8 feet in length, studded with pendulous
ball-shaped flowers with crimson sepals, yellow petals,
and dark-brown stamens which are very striking and
often remain in bloom for six months. Common.
<i>A. vitifolium</i>&mdash;Chili. A most ornamental evergreen
shrub of which there are two forms, one
bearing lavender flowers, the other white. In exceptional
cases it attains a height of 20 feet, and when
covered with its large blossoms, which are about 3
inches in diameter, and feathered to the ground with
foliage, it presents a lovely picture. Large specimens
form pyramids of bloom, and in some gardens
numbers of these are to be found. Wall protection
unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acacias.</span>&mdash;Australia. In Cornish and South Devon
gardens many species are to be met with in robust
health. <i>A. affinis</i>, very generally confounded with
<i>A. dealbata</i>, is the most common. In many cases
<i>A. affinis</i> is grown as <i>A. dealbata</i>. The leaves of the
former are green, while those of the latter are bluish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and its flowers are less bright in colour. A group
of <i>A. affinis</i> about 35 feet in height was a wonderful
sight at Tregothnan at the end of March, being
simply covered with golden blossom which was
thrown into high relief by a background of Ilexes.
<i>A. verticillata</i> is another handsome species flowering
later in the spring. It is a very rapid grower, reaching
a height of 15 feet in a few years, generally
growing in the form of a broad-based cone, with its
lower branches but a foot or so from the ground.
When in flower it is so covered with its pale-yellow
blossoms that no foliage is discernible. <i>A. armata</i>
may be seen as a bush 7 feet high and as much in
diameter. <i>A. ovata</i> Mr. Fitzherbert has only seen
as a bush some 3 feet high; very pretty when
bearing its circular, golden flower-bells. <i>A. longifolia</i>
is another handsome tree, with leaves something like
those of an Oleander and bright-yellow flowers. <i>A.
melanoxylon</i> is a fine tree. The specimen at Tresco
is about 50 feet in height, and there are good
examples on the mainland. Pale-yellow flowers
produced in profusion. Other species met with
are <i>A. riceana</i>, <i>A. (Albizzia) lophantha</i>, <i>A. calamifolia</i>,
<i>A. linifolia</i>, <i>A. latifolia</i>, and <i>A. platyptera</i>, the latter
against a wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adenandra fragrans.</span>&mdash;Cape of Good Hope. A
small evergreen shrub, bearing fragrant, rose-coloured
flowers. Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anopterus glandulosa.</span>&mdash;Tasmania. A vigorous
evergreen shrub, with dark, shining green leaves,
bearing long, erect terminal racemes of white, cup-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>shaped
flowers, resembling the blooms of <i>Clethra
arborea</i>, but larger. Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acanthopanax spinosum.</span>&mdash;Garden seedling. A
striking plant with dark-green, large-sized leaves
divided into five sections. Height at present 5 feet.
Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aster (Olearia) argophyllus.</span>&mdash;Australia. The
Silver Musk tree, with musk-scented leaves and dull-red
flowers in summer. Three gardens. Height
12 feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Athrotaxis laxifolia.</span>&mdash;Tasmania. A tender
Conifer. A fine example, 20 feet in height, fruited
profusely at Menabilly two years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Banksia grandis.</span>&mdash;Australia. Evergreen shrub,
bearing yellow flowers in dense spikes. <i>B. serrata</i>,
red flowers, and <i>B. littoralis</i>. All at Tresco. <i>B.
quercifolia</i>, handsome leaves, with white reverse.
Abbotsbury. Banksias were at one time in request
as greenhouse plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bauera rubioides.</span>&mdash;New South Wales. A pretty
little evergreen shrub not unlike a Heath, but more
branching, bearing solitary, pink, saucer-shaped
flowers half an inch across, each petal striped with
white down the centre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benthamia (Cornus capitata) fragifera.</span>&mdash;Nepaul.
A handsome, evergreen tree, first introduced
into England in 1825, when seed was sown
at Heligan, Cornwall, and where there are now specimens
some 60 feet in height. It is largely represented
throughout Cornwall, being used in some
places as a woodland tree. In June, when the leaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>age
is hidden by the wide-spread, platter-like flowers
of pale yellow, its effect is very beautiful, especially
when thrown up by a background of green foliage.
In the autumn the fruits, from which it takes its
name of Strawberry tree, some an inch or more in
diameter, become bright crimson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boronia.</span>&mdash;Australia. These are almost universally
treated as greenhouse plants, but succeed in
the open air in the south-west. At Tregothnan, at
the end of March, two bushes of <i>B. megastigma</i>,
planted in front of a wall, the larger of which was
about 3 feet in height, were coming into profuse
bloom, and already scented the air with the first of
their brown, yellow-lined, drooping cups. <i>B.
heterophylla</i>, with its purple-red flowers was also
expanding blooms, and <i>B. Drummondii</i>, <i>B. elatior</i>,
and <i>B. polygalæfolia</i> were also growing in the same
garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brachyglottis repanda.</span>&mdash;New Zealand. A
handsome tree, with leaves nearly a foot in length
and numerous minute flower-heads. Tresco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buddleia Colvillei.</span>&mdash;Sikkim. The finest of the
new race, with pendulous racemes, nearly a foot in
length, of crimson, pentstemon-like flowers, paler
round the centre, an inch across. Leaves large and
dark green, 6 inches or more in length. Several
gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Callistemon Salignus.</span>&mdash;Australia. There are
two forms of this Bottle-brush, one bearing pale-yellow
flowers and the other crimson. Others are <i>C.
lanceolatus</i>, carmine-flowered, and <i>C. speciosus</i>, scarlet-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>flowered.
These grow well as bushes, specimens of
the first-named being sometimes 10 feet in height
and as much in diameter. There is much confusion
between this genus and <i>Metrosideros floribunda</i>.
Callistemons are to be found in many gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camellia reticulata.</span>&mdash;This is hardy, but rarely
flowers satisfactorily in the open except in the south-west,
where it is grown both against walls and as a
bush plant. It is by far the finest of the Camellias,
bearing lovely, pink, semi-double flowers 6 inches
in diameter, with bright-yellow, spreading stamens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Candollea tetrandra.</span>&mdash;Australia. An evergreen
bush bearing clear-yellow, cup-shaped flowers
somewhat resembling Sun Roses, but of finer texture.
Tresco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantua buxifolia.</span>&mdash;Peru. An evergreen shrub,
bearing in corymbs at the end of the branches pale-red
trumpet-flowers something after the style of
<i>Fuchsia corymbiflora</i>. Tresco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpenteria californica.</span>&mdash;A well-known evergreen
shrub in the south-west, bearing fragrant, white,
yellow-centred flowers. In some gardens it suffers
from browning of the leaves, but this is apparently
not the effect of cold winds or frost, as often the
most exposed plants are the least affected and the
most sheltered are in the worst plight. The finest
specimen known to Mr. Fitzherbert is about 8 feet
high and as much through; it is growing near Teignmouth.
It may be considered fairly hardy since it
has been grown in the open in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caryopteris Mastacanthus.</span>&mdash;Chili. A most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
valuable, much-branched evergreen shrub growing to
a height of 4 feet or more, bearing lavender-blue
clusters of flowers in October. There is also a white
form. The type is common. This is also happy
farther north.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassinia leptophylla.</span>&mdash;New Zealand. A small
evergreen shrub, bearing white flower-heads. Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceanothus.</span>&mdash;California and Mexico. Many
species and varieties are grown both as bushes, in
which form they soon make small trees, and trained
against walls. Of the early-flowering varieties <i>C.
veitchianus</i> is the brightest coloured, and of the autumn-blooming,
azureus section, Gloire de Versailles is the
favourite. Common in most gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citharexylom quadrangulare.</span>&mdash;West Indies.
The Fiddle-wood. Bears white, fragrant flowers.
There is a fine specimen at Abbotsbury. Dorset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citrus trifoliata (&OElig;gle sepiaria).</span>&mdash;Japan.
This fiercely-spined Citrus is hardy, but rarely flowers
and fruits in the north. In the south-west it flowers
freely, and one specimen fruits almost annually.
It is 7 feet in height, and last year carried over thirty
fruits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clerodendron trichotomum.</span>&mdash;Japan. A deciduous
shrub, also hardy, but flowering best in the
south-west. A fine specimen over 15 feet in height
and as much through is at Greenway on the Dart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clethra arborea.</span>&mdash;Madeira. The Lily-of-the-Valley
tree. Evergreen. It bears panicles of white,
bell-shaped flowers in the summer, at which time it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
is quite a feature at Tresco. There are good bushes,
the largest about 7 feet in height, at Trewidden, near
Penzance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corokia buddleioides.</span>&mdash;New Zealand. A tall-growing
evergreen shrub, with leaves 2 to 6 inches
in length. <i>C. Cotoneaster</i> is a spreading shrub with
small leaves. Both species bear yellow, sweet-scented
flowers. The first was at Ludgvan Rectory,
Cornwall, the second at Bishop's Teignton. South
Devon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Correa.</span>&mdash;Australia. Greenhouse evergreen shrubs
which do well at Tresco, and also in some gardens
on the mainland. <i>C. cardinalis</i> is the most brilliant,
but <i>C. ventricosa</i> is almost as highly coloured. The
two named, as well as <i>C. alba</i>, <i>C. bicolor</i>, <i>C. carnea</i>,
<i>C. glauca</i>, <i>C. magnifica</i>, and <i>C. virens</i> are sometimes
seen in good health and flower on the mainland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corynocarpus lævigatus.</span>&mdash;New Zealand. An
evergreen tree, bearing panicles of white flowers followed
by plum-like fruit. A healthy young plant is
at Ludgvan Rectory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crinodendron Hookeri (Tricuspidaria hexapetala).</span>&mdash;Chili.
A particularly handsome shrub,
growing to a height of 5 feet, bearing large, drooping,
cherry-red, urn-shaped flowers on long peduncles,
the petals being very fine in texture. In many
gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cytisus racemosus.</span>&mdash;Peak of Teneriffe. One of
the commonest and most popular greenhouse plants.
It grows to 8 or 10 feet in height in the south-west
and often flowers until Christmas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daphne indica.</span>&mdash;India. Both the white and
purple-red form of this fragrant plant are common
in the open in Devon and Cornwall, and in mild
seasons commence to bloom in January. Some old
plants have formed large bushes in front of walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daphniphyllum glaucescens.</span>&mdash;China. Evergreen.
This is hardy, but is uncommon. A very
large specimen is at Trewidden, and is 12 feet in
height and 20 feet in spread. It has long shining
leaves, the shoots being red in colour; these, early
in April, are surrounded by closely clustered, maroon-red
flower-buds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Datura sanguinea.</span>&mdash;Peru. This grows to a
large size in the south-west, often forming a tree
12 feet or more in height, and, in mild winters,
blooming until February. <i>D. suaveolens</i>, Mexico, is
probably more tender, as such large specimens are
rarely seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dendromecon rigidus.</span>&mdash;California. A handsome
shrub with glaucous leaves, the branchlets
terminated by bright-yellow poppy-like flowers. It
succeeds best in poor soil that does not induce
vigorous growth. Enys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Desfontainea spinosa.</span>&mdash;Chili. A most distinct
evergreen shrub, with leaves resembling those of a
Holly. It bears tubular flowers 3 inches in length
of a bright vermilion tipped with yellow, and is a
very handsome object when in full flower. It commences
to bloom in the summer, and often holds
many of its flowers until November. The largest
specimen met with was about 8 feet in height, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
was in the neighbourhood of Teignmouth. The
Desfontainea is to be found in most gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diosma ericoides.</span>&mdash;South Africa. A heath-like
evergreen shrub, bearing single white flowers not
unlike those of a Myrtle. Its leaves are fragrant
when bruised. A healthy plant, about 4 ft. by 4 ft.,
trained against a wall, was coming into bloom at
Tregothnan at the end of March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diospyros Kaki.</span>&mdash;The Persimmon. China. This
is hardy, but rarely fruits except in the south-west.
A tree at Bishop's Teignton produced fruit, which
ripened well, in 1890. In autumn the colouring
of its foliage is very attractive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drimys (Tasmannia) aromatica.</span>&mdash;Tasmania. An
evergreen shrub or small tree, bearing tiny white
flowers in spring. Its leaves, if bitten, are very
pungent, stinging the palate like pepper. The finest
specimen known to the writer is one 15 feet in
height at Menabilly. <i>D. Winteri</i>&mdash;South America.
A handsome flowering shrub, bearing ivory-yellow,
fragrant flowers, an inch across. At Bishop's
Teignton there is a good example over 12 feet in
height. Both species are fairly well distributed in
gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dryobalanops aromatica.</span>&mdash;Sumatra. The Camphor
tree. There is at Penjerrick a good specimen
20 feet in height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwardsia grandiflora syn. Sophora tetraptera.</span>&mdash;The
New Zealand Laburnum. This and
its variety <i>E. microphylla</i> bear racemes of yellow
flowers, the individual blooms being 2 inches long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
in the first case, and about half the length in the
second, in the spring. Examples 10 feet or so in
height are to be found in some gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Embothrium coccineum.</span>&mdash;South America. The
Fire Bush. The most brilliant of all flowering trees
capable of outdoor culture in this country. In May
every twig is laden with clusters of long flowers of
glowing scarlet, the trees presenting a most gorgeous
spectacle. Every good garden in Cornwall and most
in South Devon possesses specimens, some containing
a dozen or more. The finest are probably
Trewidden and Penjerrick, where they are 30 feet in
height and as much in spread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eriostemon buxifolius.</span>&mdash;Australia. A small
evergreen shrub, bearing pink flowers in the spring.

Togerthnan; <i>E. amygdalina</i>, &amp;c. Many flower freely
and bear fertile seed. <i>E. Gunnii</i> flowers freely at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Parkstone, Dorset, in Professor Wallace's garden.
It is quite hardy there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eucryphia pinnatifolia.</span>&mdash;Chili. A beautiful
deciduous flowering shrub, bearing large white
flowers like a St. John's Wort, with bright-yellow
anthers. A specimen at Trewidden is 8 feet in
height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Euonymus fimbriatus.</span>&mdash;Japan and India. This
shrub is chiefly remarkable for the tint of its young
leafage, which is bright crimson, and gives a vivid,
flower-like effect at a little distance in April. Met
with at Tregothnan and Abbotsbury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eupatorium weinmannianum.</span>&mdash;South America.
This soon grows into a rounded bush 10 feet or so
in height and as much in diameter. It bears its

it is evergreen, but in this country is deciduous. A
good specimen is at Enys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fremontia californica.</span>&mdash;An extremely handsome
deciduous flowering shrub, bearing bright-yellow,
cupped flowers 3 inches in diameter with orange
stamens. It often remains in bloom for months.
Large plants have unfortunately a way of dying off
when apparently in good health, several fine specimens
having succumbed in this manner. The finest
we now know of is one growing in bush form about
8 feet in height at Newton Abbot, but the same
garden contained at one time a larger example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grevillea.</span>&mdash;Australia. <i>G. rosmarinifolia</i>, with
carmine-red flowers, forms a vigorous shrub, growing

<p><span class="smcap">Punica granatum.</span>&mdash;The Pomegranate is a neglected
shrub in English gardens. Planted at the foot
of a south wall, and treated generally like a well-groomed
Peach tree, it will flower from June to
September. It is not a shrub for cold climates, but
Mr. Watson, writing in the <i>Garden</i>, October 26, p.
283, says, "At Kew three varieties are grown outdoors,
namely, the type, the big double-white
flowered variety, with petals margined with white,
Picotee-like, and the dwarf variety known as Nana.
There are other forms beside these, including a white-flowered
one which I have seen in Paris gardens,
where old&mdash;very old&mdash;standard plants are grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and treasured. The dwarf variety is cultivated as
a pot plant in some continental countries. I have
seen it in the Hamburg florists' shops, pretty little

<h3 class="gap2">TENDER WALL PLANTS IN THE SOUTH-WEST</h3>


<p>The notes on tender shrubs and trees grown in
the south-west are fittingly supplemented by a
passing reference to plants used for covering walls,
mostly of climbing habit, but a few of shrubby
growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bignonia.</span>&mdash;<i>B. (Tecoma) radicans</i> is a hardy
climber, and <i>B. capreolata</i> may also be considered
so. Other members of the family grown in the
open are <i>B. capensis</i>, Cape of Good Hope, orange;
<i>B. Cherere</i>, Guiana, orange scarlet; and <i>B. speciosa</i>,
Uruguay, pink. Greenway on the Dart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberidopsis corallina.</span>&mdash;Chili. Drooping
crimson flowers borne in racemes in the autumn.
This evergreen plant does best in peat or leaf-mould
in a partially shaded position. Common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bougainvillea glabra.</span>&mdash;Brazil. This climber
cannot be considered a success in the open in the
south-west, but in two gardens it has been grown
and flowers, but in neither case has it exhibited a
tithe of the freedom of growth displayed by it under
glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bucklandia populnea.</span>&mdash;Himalayas. A handsome
evergreen foliage plant, said to grow to a height
of 100 feet in its native habitat. Its large heart-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>shaped
leaves are tinted with bronze and maroon.
Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Callicarpa purpurea.</span>&mdash;India. An evergreen
shrub bearing small inconspicuous flowers, followed
by violet-coloured berries. Trewidden, Penzance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cassia corymbosa.</span>&mdash;Buenos Ayres. A rambling
shrub, almost invariably grown against a wall, though
it has been met with planted against a wire fence,
and spreading out on either side. In August it is a
mass of golden-yellow bloom, some of which it often
retains until Christmas. With wall protection it
reaches a height of 12 feet or more, and when in
flower is a striking object in the garden. It is fairly
common in the south-west.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorizema.</span>&mdash;Australia. Well-known evergreen
greenhouse plants, bearing pea-like flowers of orange
and red. Masses 7 feet in height and more in
breadth grow against the walls at Trewidden, and
begin to flower in March. <i>C. cordatum</i> and <i>C. Lowii</i>
are the species generally grown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cissus discolor.</span>&mdash;Java. A climber, bearing
greenish-yellow blossoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clematis indivisa lobata.</span>&mdash;New Zealand. This
beautiful white-flowered Clematis grows well in many
gardens, and commences to bloom in March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clianthus puniceus.</span>&mdash;New Zealand. A brilliant-flowered
evergreen climber, bearing large flowers,
somewhat resembling lobsters' claws, scarlet crimson
in hue. It sometimes comes into flower as early as
Christmas, the number of its blossoms increasing
until mid-May, when it is a glowing sheet of colour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
The finest plant Mr. Fitzherbert knows is at Stoke
Fleming, near Dartmouth, where it covers the side
of a large house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diplacus (Mimulus) glutinosus.</span>&mdash;California.
Another popular greenhouse plant, bearing buff
flowers, which succeeds admirably against walls in
many gardens, growing some 5 feet in height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elæocarpus cyaneus.</span>&mdash;Australia. An evergreen
plant of shrubby growth, bearing whitish-blue flowers.
Greenway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ercilla (Bridgesia) volubilis.</span>&mdash;Chili. A self-clinging
evergreen climber, bearing inconspicuous
flowers. Fairly common, but scarcely attractive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hibbertia dentata.</span>&mdash;Australia. An evergreen
climber, with foliage of deep bronze, bearing single
bright-yellow flowers in April. Trewidden. <i>H. Reidii</i>,
also yellow-flowered. Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrangea petiolaris.</span>&mdash;Japan. A rampant-growing
climber, bearing flat flower-heads, composed
of blooms the minority of which are sterile. It clings
naturally, and is displayed to best advantage when
allowed to ascend a bare tree trunk. At Menabilly,
Cornwall, a specimen planted twelve years ago has
ascended the columnar trunk of a Turkey Oak to a
height of almost 40 feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inga pulcherrima.</span>&mdash;Mexico. An evergreen shrub,
bearing bright-scarlet flowers in summer. A fine
plant covering a large expanse of wall is at Greenway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kennedya nigricans.</span>&mdash;Australia. An evergreen
climber, bearing violet-purple racemes of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
pea-like blossoms. Greenway. <i>K. alba</i> is also
grown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lapageria.</span>&mdash;Chili. This handsome evergreen
climber, producing long wax-like blossoms of white
and rose, is well known under glass. In the south-west
it does well in the open against a north wall,
in peaty compost, often bearing its flowers as late as
Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lasiandra (Pleroma Tibouchina) macrantha.</span>&mdash;Brazil.
A beautiful evergreen shrub of climbing
habit, bearing large violet flowers. It is usually cut
down by frost, but breaks again strongly in the
spring. Trewidden and other gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mandevilla suaveolens.</span>&mdash;Buenos Ayres. A
lovely deciduous climber, bearing large, white, deliciously-fragrant
flowers in August. It does well
in several gardens in the south-west, in some of
which it seeds freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michelia (Magnolia) fuscata.</span>&mdash;China. An
evergreen or sub-evergreen shrub (according to
position), bearing dull-purple sweetly-scented flowers.
Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;nocoma prolifera.</span>&mdash;Cape of Good Hope.&mdash;An
evergreen shrub, bearing large, terminal, crimson
flower-heads. Trewidden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Physianthus albens syn. Araujia albens.</span>&mdash;Brazil.
An evergreen climber, bearing a profusion
of white flowers, which later assume a reddish tinge.
Common in the south-west. The finest specimen
Mr. Fitzherbert has seen grew against a cliff-face
in the public gardens at Torquay. It spread to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
height and breadth of considerably over 20 feet, and
one year bore over a dozen huge corrugated seed-pods,
about the size of a cricket ball, but oval in
shape. This strain killed the plant, but a young one
has now taken its place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plumbago capensis.</span>&mdash;Cape of Good Hope. A
climbing evergreen shrub, bearing large heads of pale-blue
flowers; a favourite conservatory plant. It is
grown in several gardens, and flowers well in the
open. A fine example, which has been unprotected
for five months, is growing in the same site as the
Physianthus alluded to above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pueraria thunbergiana.</span>&mdash;Khasia. An evergreen
climber, with leaves 5 inches in diameter, bearing
blue flowers. Fibre is obtained from the stems and
starch from the roots. Tregothnan.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">PUERARIA THUNBERGIANA.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhodochiton volubile.</span>&mdash;Mexico. A climber,
bearing blood-red drooping flowers. This plant, in
common with Lothospermum and Maurandya, all
three of which are perennials, is almost invariably
killed by the winter, but is easily raised from seed.
Rosehill, Falmouth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhynchospermum (Trachelospermum) jasminoides.</span>&mdash;Shanghai.
An evergreen climber, hardy in
the south-west, bearing countless starry-white flowers,
most delicately perfumed in August. It is to be met
with in the majority of gardens, and in one it has
covered the house porch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruscus androgynus syn. Semele androgyna.</span>&mdash;Canary
Islands. An evergreen climber, valuable for
its striking foliage. The leaves, or rather cladodes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
are over a foot in length, and are furnished with
from twelve to twenty pinnate sections of a glossy
green. Penjerrick, Falmouth, where it has borne its
inconspicuous greenish-white flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solanum wendlandi.</span>&mdash;Costa Rica. An evergreen
climber, bearing clusters of large lilac-blue flowers,
2&frac12; inches in diameter. The late Rev. H. Ewbank,
in whose garden at Ryde the finest specimen we
have seen was growing, considered it the best of all
the tender climbers amenable to open-air culture in
the south-west.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sollya heterophylla.</span>&mdash;Australia. Bluebell
Creeper. An evergreen climber, bearing drooping
blue flowers. Tregothnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stauntonia (Holb&oelig;llia) latifolia.</span>&mdash;Himalayas.
An evergreen climber, with oval leathery leaves,
bearing in April clusters of greenish-white flowers,
delightfully odorous. A very common plant in the
south-west.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Streptosolen Jamesoni.</span>&mdash;Columbia. A handsome
evergreen shrub, in great request for clothing
conservatory pillars, &amp;c. It bears panicles of orange-red
flowers, and when in full bloom has a brilliant
effect. A plant about 7 feet in height is growing
against the house at Trewidden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swainsonia albiflora.</span>&mdash;Australia. An evergreen
leguminous shrub, bearing white pea-like flowers,
well known in greenhouses. It is grown in several
gardens, and if cut down by sharp frosts breaks
strongly again in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tacsonia exonensis.</span>&mdash;A hybrid between <i>T. Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Volxemii</i> and <i>T. mollissima</i>. Bearing bright rosy-pink
flowers. Trewidden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T. mollissima.</span>&mdash;Quito. A vigorous species, bearing
pink flowers, with tubes from 4 to 5 inches in
length. Though Quito is on the equator, its height
above sea-level being 9600 feet, the temperature is
not unduly high. There is a large plant, which has
had to be kept within bounds by periodical pruning,
at Rosehill.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">TREES AND SHRUBS IN IRELAND</h3>


<p>It is not possible, without going beyond the limits of
a volume of comfortable size, to do anything approaching
justice to the trees and shrubs that are the
glory of many gardens in the sister Isle. It is a
favoured isle for the growth of Conifers, and trees
and shrubs that in other parts of Britain, except
under exceptional conditions, completely fail. The
Sikkim Rhododendrons at Kilmacurragh, Co. Wicklow,
the residence of Mr. Thomas Acton, D.L.; the
Rhododendrons and Ghent Azaleas at Houth Castle,
Co. Dublin; the noble Conifers in the gardens
of Viscount Powerscourt at Enniskerry, Wicklow,
and of Lord Annesley, Castlewellan, Co. Down,
besides other counties, are well known to every one
deeply interested in trees and shrubs; while among
other notable gardens filled with rare treasures and
specimens of individual development may be named,
St. Annes', Clontarf, Co. Dublin; Cong, Co. Mayo;
and Muckross, Killarney, residences of Lord Ardilaun.
The gardens of Mr. W. E. Gumbleton,
Belgrove, Queenstown, Cork, contain interesting collections;
and the same may be said of Straffan,
Co. Kildare, the Duke of Leinster's famous residence;
Carton, near Maynooth, in the same county; Wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>stock,
Kilkenny, the residence of Mrs. Tighe; Hamwood,
Dunboyne, Co. Meath (Mr. R. Hamilton, D.L.);
Killarney House, Killarney (the Lord Kenmare);
Kylemore, Co. Mayo (Mr. Mitchell Henry); and
Narrow Water Park, Co. Down (Capt. Roger Hall).
And we are not forgetful of the beautiful Fota
Island near Cork (Lord Barrymore), where plants
accounted tender in more northerly latitudes flourish
with almost tropical luxuriance.</p>

<p>The gardens of Ireland must be seen to realise
their beauty and climatic advantages. Ireland is
happy in having many enthusiastic gardeners, and
it will be well for those who wish for some information
as to the great variety of trees and shrubs
that will live unprotected in the sister Isle to read the
contribution of the Earl of Annesley to the Journal
of the Royal Horticultural Society, upon "Ornamental
Trees and Shrubs in the Gardens at Castlewellan,
Co. Down," vol. xxviii. The Earl's garden, to quote
his own words, "Is on one of the foot hills of the
Mourne Mountains in the county of Down, about
three miles from the Irish Channel, thus benefiting
by the mild influence of the Gulf Stream: it faces
east and south, and is surrounded by old forest trees,
so that it is well sheltered. We suffer little from
frost; ten degrees is the average; once, in the hard
winter of 1895, we had fifteen degrees. The rainfall
is about thirty-two inches; the subsoil is gravel,
and as it lies on rather a steep hill there is perfect
drainage&mdash;a great advantage for tender, as indeed it
is for all plants."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>In a future edition of this work, if it be called for,
the gardens of Ireland in relation to the trees and
shrubs that are grown therein will receive greater
justice than it is possible to give at present, owing to
the number of rare and tender species and varieties
that are at home in the sister Isle. Ireland has two
interesting Botanic gardens, one attached to Trinity
College, Dublin, of which Mr. F. W. Burbidge, M.A.,
is the well-known curator, and the other at Glasnevin.
This is under the care of Mr. F. W. Moore and is
exceptionally beautiful. Both contain rare trees and
shrubs, but the terrific storm in the early part of
1903 wrought sad havoc.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">HARDY BAMBOOS</h3>


<p>Thanks to Lord Redesdale (author of "The Bamboo
Garden"), and a few other gardening enthusiasts,
the Bamboo has been made a beautiful feature
of many English gardens. Although a graceful
shrubby grass of quite tropical aspect, the majority
of species and their varieties are thoroughly hardy,
so much so that they have passed safely through
the severest winters of the past twenty years.
Bamboos and hybrid Water Lilies are responsible
for much of the interest taken in good English
gardening at the present time. Their introduction
has marked a distinct era, and their popularity
is wide-spread, while in the near future we shall
regard the Bamboo much as we do the most common
of shrubs now planted. <i>Arundinaria japonica</i> (<i>B.
Metake</i>) is, of course, an old favourite, and it is
surprising that this stately species did not before
remind English gardeners of the great possibilities
of the Bamboos in the adornment of the pleasure-ground.
As Mr. Bean says: "Fifteen or twenty
years ago many of the best of the sorts now largely
grown were unknown in this country; but apart
from their novelty they have other qualities. No
evergreens capable of withstanding our winters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
exceed these shrubby grasses in beauty and grace,
in luxuriance of leafage, or in their bright, fresh,
green tints in winter. Very few, indeed, equal
them."</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">GROUPING OF YUCCAS, PAMPAS GRASS, AND BAMBOOS, KEW (Winter).</p>

<p>Although fifty species and varieties of this lovely
family are now grown, only about twenty need be
thought of, because many of them from the ornamental
point of view are valueless in the English
garden. The hardy Bamboos belong to three groups
or genera&mdash;<i>Phyllostachys</i>, <i>Arundinaria</i>, and <i>Bambusa</i>&mdash;and
it is well to thoroughly understand these divisions.
We hope those trade growers who still group everything
as Bambusa will follow the now accepted
classification. The following have proved the most
hardy and beautiful in the Bamboo garden at Kew:
<i>Phyllostachys Henonis</i>, <i>P. fastuosa</i>, <i>P. viridi-glaucescens</i>,
<i>P. flexuosa</i>, <i>P. nigra</i>, <i>P. boryana</i>, <i>P. sulphurea</i>, <i>P. Marliacea</i>,
<i>P. ruscifolia</i>, <i>P. Castillonis</i>, <i>Arundinaria nitida</i>,
<i>A. japonica</i>, <i>A. auricoma</i>, <i>A. Simoni</i>, <i>A. Fortunei</i>, <i>A.
anceps</i>, <i>A. Hindsii var. graminea</i>, <i>Bambusa palmata</i>, <i>B.
tessellata</i>, and <i>B. marmorea</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;"><a id="image0057" name="image0057" href="images/illus0298.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">BAMBOO GARDEN AT KEW, WINTER</p>

<p class="caption">(In centre, Bambusa palmata; left, Phyllostachys Quilioi; right, Bambusa tessellata).]</p>

<p>In selecting a place for the Bamboo colony, think
well of position. Shelter from north and east is
essential. Luxuriant leafy stems are only possible
when the plants are screened from winds in these
quarters, indeed from <i>all</i> winds. Cold north and
east winds are more harmful than severe frost, and
this applies to all the tender evergreens. A moist
and rich soil is also important. Without it luxuriant
growth is impossible, and a Bamboo that is not leafy,
that does not bend its tall, graceful stems to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
breeze and make willowy shoots yards high, when it
is natural for it so to do, is not beautiful: the
garden is more interesting without it. Many of the
species spread rapidly by underground stems, and
for this reason must never be planted without careful
thought. Each plant should tell its own tale, and
not suffer partial extinction through a choke-muddle
arrangement that makes a bank of leafage perhaps,
but in which all individual beauty is hopelessly
lost. Some Bamboos, like <i>Phyllostachys viridi-glaucescens</i>
and <i>P. Henonis</i>, need ample space for full
development. Transplant always in <i>late spring</i>,
never in winter and early spring. When bamboos
were first grown in this country on a large scale
many deaths occurred through transplanting in
winter.</p>

<p>With the utmost care Bamboos in the fickle British
climate get sadly browned in February and May,
the outcome of either a hard winter or keen east
winds in spring. The stems are seldom injured, and
Mr. Bean says "the underground portion of the
plants never is." This scorched look is not beautiful,
and is more apparent as the spring meets summer,
when the whole plant world is bursting into new life
and tinting the landscape with green. Therefore,
Bamboos can never be planted so lavishly as Rhododendrons;
and we do not desire a Bamboo plague,
beautiful though the plants are in foliage and growth,
so perhaps the east wind is somewhat of a blessing.
Bamboos must have favoured spots. When a single
group is desired, then choose some sheltered corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
and the same consideration is necessary when making
a Bamboo garden or grove. A beautiful and refreshing
feature of many English homes is a ravine of
these lovely grasses, and the Bamboo colony at Kew
is accounted one of the most delightful spots in the
Royal Gardens.</p>

<p>In the <i>Garden</i> of February 1, 1902, pp. 73, 74, is
an interesting account of the Bamboos at Kew. As
this contains much practical information, it is reproduced:
"Kew was one of the first gardens in
which hardy Bamboos were grown, and it is to a
great extent due to this collection, and the collections
of Mr. Freeman Mitford, Messrs. Verten, and a few
other pioneers, that the planting of hardy Bamboos
has assumed its present proportions. The creation
of the Kew Bamboo garden dates back to 1892.
Previous to that the cultivation of hardy Bamboos
had been practised under great difficulties. The
collection contained only a few species, planted in
poor soil in an exposed position, and were always
unsatisfactory. In addition to Bamboos, there were
other monocotyledonous plants in the same plight,
hence the happy idea was conceived of forming the
present Bamboo garden. This garden is situated on
the eastern side of the Rhododendron dell, near the
north or Sion Vista end. It was originally a shallow
gravel pit, and is peculiarly adapted to the requirements
of Bamboos. The depression in the ground
and the high bank of the Rhododendron dell give
considerable shelter, whilst a wide belt of large forest
trees, which surrounds the north, east, and south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
sides, insures almost complete protection from cold
winds. The garden is pear-shaped, and can be entered
by three paths on the south-east, west, and
north sides. The banks round the sides are terraced,
and held up by large tree roots placed roots outwards,
the roots forming numerous bays and corners, each
of which is given over to one species. Separated
from these bays by a gravel path 9 feet wide is a
central bed of about a quarter of an acre. This is
filled with large clumps of various species and fine
single specimens, arranged in such a way as to open
a vista right through the bed here and there or into
the centre. These vistas and openings, together with
the paths, add greatly to the general effect, the plants
and groups being well separated and showing to advantage,
while the beauty of the stately upright stems
of some and arching plumes of others, lining or
bending over and almost meeting across the openings,
is at once seen. Intermixed with the Bamboos are
Yuccas, Miscanthus, Pampas Grass, and other things,
all of which help to give pleasing variety. Between
the back of the garden and the belt of trees a screen
is formed of <i>Rosa multiflora</i>, Spiræas, Rhododendrons,
and other shrubs, interspersed with clumps of Pampas
Grass, Yuccas, and some of the strongest and hardiest
of the Bamboos.</p>

<p>"When first formed, stiff loam to a depth of 3
feet was spread all over the garden, and into this
large quantities of decayed leaves were mixed; in
this soil the plants have thriven well. A water
main runs through the garden, so that copious sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>plies
of water can be given in dry weather with little
trouble.</p>

<p>"Altogether some forty-one species and varieties of
Bamboos are cultivated. These are composed of
seventeen <i>Arundinarias</i>, nine <i>Bambusas</i>, and fifteen
<i>Phyllostachys</i>. The majority belong to China and
Japan, one, however, belonging to North America,
and one to India. The Indian species, <i>Arundinaria
(Thamnocalamus) Falconeri</i>, which does so well in the
south-west counties and in Ireland, is the most
difficult to manage, and is killed to the ground every
winter, while <i>A. falcata</i> and <i>A. nobilis</i>, which are two
of the most common species in the famous Cornish
gardens, refuse to thrive.</p>

<p>"The arrangement of the plants has undergone considerable
modification since the first planting, owing
to natural development and the introduction of more
species. This has resulted in the removal of many
duplicates which have been used with large Rhododendrons
as an undergrowth to the wood adjoining
the entrances, thus considerably enhancing the
beauty of the place.</p>

<p>"The period of the year at which the garden is at
its best extends from the early weeks of July until
the Cold east winds in February and March, for,
although severe frost has little effect on the leaves of
many, cold winds from east or north quickly turn
them brown. That Bamboos should continue in
good condition and practically be at their best
through the worst of the winter months is a strong
recommendation in their favour, and by leaving, as is
done at Kew, the tall dead stems and leaves of <i>Mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>canthus</i>
and the plumes of the Pampas Grass, touches
of colour are given to relieve the greenery, and add
greatly to the general effect.</p>

<p>"Of groups and single specimens the following are
some of the most conspicuous:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Arundinaria.</span>&mdash;<i>A. Simoni</i>, a fine irregular mass,
16 feet high and 50 feet across. <i>A. nitida</i>, several
fine clumps, 11 feet high and 12 feet across. <i>A.
japonica</i>, several large clumps, 11 feet high and 20
feet across. <i>A. Hindsii var. graminea</i>, 9 feet high by
12 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Bambusa.</span>&mdash;<i>B. palmata</i>, 7 feet high and 15 feet
across; this is very distinct and handsome, and
should be in every collection.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Phyllostachys.</span>&mdash;<i>P. aurea</i>, 12 feet high by 16
feet through. <i>P. Henonis</i>, 15 feet high by 12 feet.
<i>P. Castillonis</i>, 12 feet high by 10 feet. <i>P. nigra</i>, 15
feet high; several fine masses. <i>P. viridi-glaucescens</i>,
15 feet high and 6 feet through at the base, the top
spreading to 20 feet. There is also a fine specimen
of this in another part of the garden.</p>

<p>"Besides these there are many other fine masses.</p>

<p>"Among plants other than Bamboos found in the
garden the Yuccas are possibly next in importance.
One group is on a bank on the north side having a
slope to the south. It is thus exposed to full sun
and the plants are happy. In both summer and
winter the group forms a delightful picture. The
groundwork is composed of the elegant glaucous-leaved
<i>Y. angustifolia</i>, while here and there a plant of
<i>Y. filamentosa</i> has crept in. Height is given to the
group by dot plants of <i>Y. gloriosa</i> and <i>Y. recurvifolia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
while a plant of <i>Cotoneaster thymifolia</i> growing between
the roots in front adds a little in the way of variety.
The whole picture is set in an irregular framing of
Bamboos and other plants, some of the most conspicuous
of which are <i>Miscanthus sinensis</i> in front,
<i>Arundinaria japonica</i>, <i>A. Hindsii var. graminea</i>, <i>Phyllostachys
aurea</i> and <i>P. Castillonis</i>, and Pampas Grass at
the back and sides.</p>

<p>"A collection of hardy species of Smilax is allowed
to ramble at will over the tree roots which form the
bays, each species having its own particular place.

<h3 class="gap2">THE HEATHS</h3>


<p>Few groups of small flowering shrubs are so charming
in the garden as the hardy Heaths. Their
usually neat growth, profusion of flowers, and length
of time they are in beauty&mdash;sometimes three or four
months&mdash;make them of great garden value. Not
more than twelve species can be grown in the open
air, but, with one or two exceptions, all are beautiful,
as the following complete list suggests: <i>Erica arborea</i>,
<i>E. australis</i>, <i>E. carnea</i>, <i>E. ciliaris</i>, <i>E. cinerea</i>, <i>E. lusitanica</i>
(or <i>codonodes</i>), <i>E. Mackaii</i>, <i>E. mediterranea</i>, <i>E. multiflora</i>,
<i>E. scoparia</i>, <i>E. stricta</i>, <i>E. Tetralix</i>, and <i>E. vagans</i>.</p>

<p>When the whole group is grown, one or more
species may be had in flower every month in the
year, except, perhaps, November. A hybrid between
<i>E. mediterranea</i> and <i>E. carnea</i> (sold under the name
of <i>mediterranea hybrida</i>) has been seen much of
late, and is a very welcome little shrub, flowers
appearing in some years even in November. Every
year some expand before Christmas, and during
January it is the brightest plant in the outdoor
garden. <i>E. carnea</i> and the white variety follow it;
then in a cluster come <i>E. australis</i>, <i>E. arborea</i>, <i>E.
lusitanica</i> (<i>codonodes</i>), <i>E. mediterranea</i> and its several
varieties, which fill up the months from March to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
May, and from June onwards we have <i>E. cinerea</i>, <i>E.
ciliaris</i>, <i>E. Mackaii</i>, <i>E. scoparia</i> (the least worthy of
the Heaths), <i>E. stricta</i>, and <i>E. Tetralix</i>. The two
allied species, <i>E. vagans</i> and <i>E. multiflora</i>, carry on
the Heath season until October.</p>

<p>The Heaths are happiest in a peaty soil. The
great Heath nurseries are all on soil of that nature,
but it is not essential. A loamy medium can, by
adding leaf-mould and, if necessary, sand, be made to
suit all the Heaths, and some, such as <i>E. cinerea</i> and
<i>E. mediterranea</i>, are quite at home on a calcareous soil.
Choose positions for them well exposed to the sun,
with, if possible, a cool, moist bottom. The ways of
planting vary, of course, according to the character
of the species and varieties selected. The rather
free-growing and taller Heaths, like <i>lusitanica</i> and
<i>arborea</i>, may be planted in informal groups on
sloping banks, or more sparsely with a dwarfer
species like <i>E. carnea</i> as the groundwork. <i>E. lusitanica</i>
and <i>E. arborea</i>, being somewhat tender, are
only seen at their best in the south and west, but
beautiful effects have been got by planting them
in irregular and scattered groups on grassy slopes.
The natural grouping of Gorse and Broom suggests
a way of using the many beautiful Heaths.</p>

<p><i>E. mediterranea</i> and its varieties, a beautiful group,
and much hardier than the two species just mentioned,
have flowers of shades of purple and white.
Delightful effects are possible when they are planted
in bold, informal groups, especially on sloping banks
or ground, their flowers appearing over a period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
ten or twelve weeks. Dwarf Heaths, like <i>E. carnea</i>,
<i>c. alba</i>, <i>cinerea</i>, &amp;c., may be used as edgings to beds
of heathy plants. I am indebted to Mr. Bean for
the following excellent notes about the Heaths, and
the reason this group has a chapter to itself is
to encourage a greater use of shrubs, strangely
neglected in English gardens. The beauty of Heath
in bloom appeals to poet and painter. Moorlands
surfaced with colour, hill upon hill of softened shades
fading away in the distance, are pleasant memories&mdash;pictures
beautiful enough, we should have thought,
to tempt the planter of the English garden to reproduce
in a small way in the homelands. I hope this
chapter will do something to make the beautiful
wild Heaths and their varieties welcome in rough,
peaty grounds and banks, and the many other places
where they would be as happy as on their native
moors and hillsides.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">The Taller or Tree-like Heaths</h3>

<p><i>Erica arborea.</i>&mdash;This is the most remarkable of all
the hardy Heaths; it grows to quite a small tree. In
the Isle of Wight, and doubtless elsewhere, it has
been known to grow 30 feet high, with a trunk 39
inches in circumference. It is found wild in considerable
abundance along the Mediterranean coast
region between Genoa and Marseilles, the wood
being used in the manufacture of the so-called Briar
pipes, Briar being a corruption of the French word
Bruyère. All the Heaths flower with great freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
but none more so than <i>E. arborea</i> and its near ally,
<i>E. lusitanica</i>. The flowers are almost globular and
nearly white; they are quite small individually, but
produced so abundantly that the plants are smothered
with them from March to May. My experience of
this species is that it is hardier and thrives altogether
better in the London district than <i>E. lusitanica</i>, a species
for which it is often grown. It ripens seed every
year almost, and can thus be readily increased in a
natural way. The young wood is densely covered
with short dark hairs and the leaves are closely
packed in whorls of three.</p>

<p><i>E. lusitanica</i> (syn. <i>codonodes</i>).&mdash;Many will not recognise
the name <i>lusitanica</i> as applied to the well-known
<i>E. codonodes</i>, but <i>lusitanica</i> is really an older designation.
This Heath, as its name implies, comes from
Portugal; it is also a native of Spain, and is often
confounded with <i>E. arborea</i>. Briefly, they differ in
the following respects: The flowers of <i>E. lusitanica</i>
are longer and more bell-shaped than the globular
ones of <i>E. arborea</i>; the foliage of <i>E. lusitanica</i> is a
rather pale green, and has a rather more plumose
look, the individual leaf being longer and more
slender; the young wood, although downy, is not so
hairy as in <i>E. arborea</i>. The remarkable abundance
of flowers, a feature of <i>E. arborea</i>, is quite as apparent
in this species, their colouring is a faintly pink-tinged
white. From Messrs. R. Veitch and Sons, of Exeter,
who are taking a special interest in these tree Heaths
Kew has lately received a form intermediate between
<i>E. arborea</i> and <i>E. lusitanica</i>&mdash;probably it is a hybrid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
<i>E. lusitanica</i> does not apparently grow so large as
<i>E. arborea</i>, but it is recorded to have reached 12
feet in height in Sussex. Farther west, in Dorsetshire,
it grows luxuriantly, and is certainly one of the
loveliest of evergreens that can be grown even in
that favoured county. Seeds afford the best means
of propagation.</p>

<p><i>E. australis.</i>&mdash;One of the most beautiful and rare
of all the Heaths, but unfortunately it is not so hardy
as the majority. In the southern and western counties,
however, it will thrive admirably, withstanding 20
degrees of frost without serious injury, provided the
winter is not unusually protracted. It is curious that
in spite of its beauty it is little known even in Cornwall,
Devon, and similar localities, where it would
doubtless thrive to perfection. It has been grown
at Kew for the last six years, and although the winters
during that period have not been very severe, it has
stood out all the time, and it flowers regularly and
profusely every spring. It can be increased by
cuttings put in at the end of July or the beginning
of August. <i>E. australis</i> is a native of Spain and
Portugal; it flowers in April and May, and lasts eight
weeks in beauty. The flowers are rich, bright, rosy
red, brighter, indeed, than those of any other Heath;
they are fragrant, pitcher-shaped, and about a quarter-inch
long. The species has been confounded with
<i>E. mediterranea</i>, which often does duty for it, but
it is distinguished by having the flowers produced
generally four or eight together in terminal clusters.
(Those of <i>E. mediterranea</i> appear in the leaf axils.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Those who have gardens in well-sheltered or mild
localities should grow this beautiful Heath. The
difficulty at present is to get hold of the right
thing; I am glad to know, however, that some
trade firms are taking it up. It is said to grow
6 to 8 feet high, but I have not seen plants half
as high.</p>

<img src="images/illus0313th.jpg" width="233" height="167" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL HEATHS (Erica carnea).</p>

<p><i>E. mediterranea.</i>&mdash;Of all the taller Heaths this is the
one, I think, that deserves to be most freely planted
in districts no warmer than the London one. The
three preceding species, so beautiful when seen at
their best, are more comfortable in the southern and
western counties. Of sturdier constitution, <i>E. mediterranea</i>
may be planted in large quantities with a
view to producing broad effects. At Kew a group
70 feet across, planted three or four years ago, already
makes a striking mass of purple each spring. The
habit of remaining for a long time in full beauty,
which is so marked a characteristic of the Heaths,
is possessed to the full extent by this species. It is
beautiful from March to May, and is all the more
appreciated because the majority of the trees and
shrubs that bloom at this season have yellow, pink,
or white flowers. In the typical <i>E. mediterranea</i> the
flowers are bright rosy red, but there is a charming
white-flowered variety (<i>alba</i>), another with bluish
foliage (<i>glauca</i>), and a dwarf one (<i>nana</i>). The flowers
appear near the ends of the shoots in the axils of
the leaves, and are pitcher-shaped. The name <i>mediterranea</i>
is misleading, for according to Moggridge,
the Mediterranean botanist, it is not a native of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
region at all; it is rather of Biscayan origin, and is
found in Western France and Spain.</p>

<p>On the boggy heaths of Galway and Mayo a form
of this species is found; it is known as <i>E. mediterranea
var. hibernica</i>, and grows 2 to 5 feet high. The
typical <i>E. mediterranea</i> was represented in the Syon
gardens seventy years ago by a specimen 10 feet high.
Do any such noble examples remain in this country
now? <i>E. mediterranea hybrida</i> has been already
alluded to.</p>

<p><i>E. stricta.</i>&mdash;Although not so strikingly beautiful as
the Heaths previously mentioned, <i>E. stricta</i> is the
hardiest of all the taller species. In inclement districts,
where a tall Heath is desired, it may be recommended;
it grows from 5 to 6 feet high, and is of
erect and sturdy growth, with leaves borne in whorls
four to six together; they are deep green, and a large
mass of plants with their erect plumose branches
produces a somewhat unusual effect. <i>E. stricta</i>, like
so many Heaths, has a long flowering season; it
begins to bloom in June, is at its best in July, but
three months later flowers may still be gathered.
The flowers are pale purple, and produced in terminal
clusters. It has been in cultivation since 1765, and
is a native of South-Western Europe; it is occasionally
labelled <i>E. ramulosa</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;"><a id="image0059" name="image0059" href="images/illus0314.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">A GROUPING OF HEATHS (Erica mediterranea and vars. alba and hybrida).</p>

<p><i>E. scoparia.</i>&mdash;This species has proved to be the
tallest Heath near London, for it has during the
last few years grown as high as 9 feet. This gives
it a certain distinction, but when regarded as a
flower-bearing plant it is, I think, the least worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of the tribe. The flowers are crowded in the leaf
axils in great profusion, but are small and greenish
white; the growth of the plant is somewhat straggling
and uneven, but it has one merit&mdash;viz., it is quite
hardy. I have seen its stems split by hard frost on
more than one occasion during the last twelve years,
but no permanent injury has resulted. It flowers in
June, and is a native of the mountainous country
to the north of the Mediterranean, especially about
Mentone.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">The Dwarfer Heaths</h3>

<p>The dwarf Heaths can be used quite differently
from the more tree-like species that have just been
described: as a carpeting beneath sparsely-planted
shrubs, for furnishing sloping banks, or for growing
on the small terraces of the Rock Garden they are
equally useful. And of all these dwarf Heaths more
can be said in favour of <i>E. carnea</i> than of any other
species. It is not only absolutely hardy, but it
flowers with astonishing freedom at a time of year
when flowers are particularly cherished. Its flowering,
of course, somewhat depends upon the weather,
but frequently one may see its bright rosy bells
almost as soon as January comes in. By the end
of February the entire plant is a mass of beautiful
colour, and for two or three months longer they
retain their freshness no matter what weather may
occur. So free-flowering is this Heath that its flowers
literally cover it. <i>E. carnea</i> is one of those plants (and
there are many of them) which, although perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
well known and quite common, are still not used in
gardens so freely as they ought to be. The majority
of our early-flowering plants bear flowers that are
either white or yellow, so that the rosy-red colouring
of this Erica makes a welcome change. However
freely it might be planted it would never become
wearisome or out of place, for its tints, though bright
and warm, are not harsh. Statements have been
recently published to the effect that <i>E. carnea</i> is a
British plant. This idea appears to have originated
with Bentham, the botanist, who regarded <i>E. carnea</i>
and <i>E. mediterranea</i> as the same species. Following
out this idea, he included the plant which has already
been alluded to as a form of <i>E. mediterranea</i>, which is
found in Western Ireland, in his Flora of Britain as a
form of <i>E. carnea</i>. Possibly he was right from the
standpoint of the botanist, but the plant grown in
gardens and nurseries as <i>E. carnea</i> is quite distinct
from <i>E. mediterranea</i>. It is usually not more than
6 to 8 inches high, and is a native of the mountains
of Central Europe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 214px;"><a id="image0060" name="image0060" href="images/illus0317.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0317th.jpg" width="214" height="147" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">WHITE SCOTCH HEATHER (Erica cinerea alba).</p>

<p><i>E. cinerea</i> (Scotch Heather).&mdash;Over almost the
whole of these islands, from the Highlands of Scotland
to the moors of Devon and Cornwall, this
Heath occurs more or less abundantly. During the
late summer and early autumn&mdash;it flowers from
July onwards&mdash;it covers miles of Exmoor with
bright-purple colouring, being usually associated
with one of the dwarf autumn-flowering Gorses
(<i>Ulex Gallii</i>). In gardens it has produced several
forms, the two most brilliantly coloured being <i>atro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>sanguinea</i>
and <i>atropurpurea</i>, but all the forms of this
Heath are beautiful in colour, ranging from white
to crimson. <i>E. carnea</i> loves the cool pure mountain
air, and on hot and sandy soil in the Thames Valley
is short-lived. At the same time it thrives admirably
in gardens where a moist, cool bottom can be
provided and where the air is pure. Altogether it
makes an admirable succession to <i>E. carnea</i>.</p>

<p><i>E. ciliaris</i> (Dorset Heath).&mdash;Although in smoky
and foggy places, such as London, this Heath is
not always satisfactory, in the purer air of the surrounding
counties it is a delightful shrub. In some
of the old oak-bearing country, in Sussex, for instance,
it succeeds to perfection. It is a native of
Britain, but is, I believe, confined to Cornwall and
Dorset in England, and to Galway in Ireland. It
has long, slender, prostrate stems, from which spring
erect flower-bearing branches; the rich rose-purple
flowers are borne in a long raceme, and they are
the largest individually of those of all the native
Heaths. The leaves are nearly always in threes,
and, like all the younger parts of the plant, are
covered with hairs and pubescence; it flowers from
July onwards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;"><a id="image0061" name="image0061" href="images/illus0318.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0318th.jpg" width="255" height="166" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">WHITE MEDITERRANEAN HEATH (Erica mediterranea alba).</p>

<p><i>E. maweana.</i>&mdash;This appears to be a fine variety
of <i>E. ciliaris</i>, with larger leaves and flowers, even
richer in colour and of sturdier growth. It was
discovered in Portugal some thirty years or so ago
by Mr. George Maw, but has not become popular
notwithstanding its beauty. It was obtained for
the Kew collection from Messrs. Cunningham and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Fraser, of Edinburgh, three or four years ago, and
certainly promises to be a better grower there than
<i>E. ciliaris</i>. The flowers are rich crimson and in
large racemes.</p>

<p><i>E. Watsoni.</i>&mdash;This is a supposed natural hybrid
between <i>E. ciliaris</i> and <i>E. Tetralix</i>, and was first
discovered near Truro by Mr. H. C. Watson. It
has rosy-crimson flowers produced in a flatter
raceme than that of <i>E. ciliaris</i>. In this character
and in other ways it is intermediate between the
parents.</p>

<p><i>E. Tetralix</i> (the Cross-leaved Heath or Bell
Heather).&mdash;This beautiful Heath grows on most
of the moors and mountain-sides throughout the
British Isles, being perhaps the most widely spread
of all the true Ericas in this country. It is called
the "Cross-leaved Heath" because of the arrangement
of the leaves, which are in whorls of four.
It is not very distinct in general appearance from
<i>E. ciliaris</i>, being downy and hairy on its young
slender leaves, &amp;c. It differs, however, in the
arrangement of the flowers, which are in a terminal
umbel. The leaves of <i>E. ciliaris</i> are usually in
threes at each node, and, of course, its distribution
in Britain is much more restricted than that of
<i>E. Tetralix</i>. There are other minor points of difference
that need not be referred to here. The
"Cross-leaved Heath" grows 1 to 1&frac12; feet high,
and has bright rose-coloured flowers. There is a
white-flowered variety (<i>alba</i>), and a very pubescent
one named <i>mollis</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p><i>E. Mackaii.</i>&mdash;This is so closely allied to <i>E. Tetralix</i>
that it is regarded merely as a variety by some
authorities. It was first found in Galway in Ireland,
between Roundstone Bay and Clifden. It has
since proved to be a native also of Spain. It is
a charming garden plant flowering from July to
September. The leaves have the same right-angled
arrangement as those of <i>E. Tetralix</i>, but the flower
is shorter, broader, and of a paler rose.</p>

<p><i>E. vagans</i> (Cornish Heath).&mdash;This Heath is one
of the most useful of dwarf evergreens, growing
vigorously, especially when planted in good soil.
I think, however, it flowers better and has more
of the typical Heath character when in somewhat
poor, sandy soil. In England it is almost or quite
confined to Cornwall, but occurs also in Ireland
and South-West Europe. It is especially valuable
in the garden because it flowers late, beginning in
July and keeping on until October. Its flowers are
crowded in racemes 4 to 6 inches long, and they
are pinkish purple in colour. The plants may be
kept neater and more compact by removing the
flowering portion of the shoots before growth
recommences in the following spring. Left to
themselves, especially in soil that is at all
rich, the plants are apt to get straggling and unkempt.</p>

<p><i>E. multiflora.</i>&mdash;This belongs to the same type of
Heath as <i>E. vagans</i>, the Cornish Heath, but differs
in its more compact growth and shorter racemes of
flowers. Although not so vigorous and showy, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
may still be preferred for some situations. It is a
neater plant, and its lower branches have not the
same tendency to get sprawling and ungainly as
<i>E. vagans</i>. In other respects it is much like that
species, the leaves being of similar shape and
arrangement, and the flowers of a paler purple;
the raceme, however, is only 2 inches or so
long. <i>E. multiflora</i> is not found in Britain, but
is a native of the country to the north of the
Mediterranean Sea from France to Greece.</p>

<p><i>Calluna vulgaris.</i>&mdash;This has been named Erica
(Heath), and may be appropriately included in this
chapter on Heaths. It is the Common Heath of mountain
and moor, is very closely allied to the true Heaths,
and has given rise to many varieties. It likes a peaty
or sandy soil, and is longer-lived and more profuse
flowering under cultivation in poor rather than rich
soil. It is very charming when grown in natural
masses in the wilder parts of the garden, and its
value is all the greater because it flowers when
almost all other shrubs are out of bloom, viz., from
July to October. Numerous varieties are offered by
the trade, amongst which the following are the most
noteworthy, either for their beauty or for their distinctness:
<i>Alba</i> (white), <i>Alporti</i> (crimson), <i>aurea</i>
(golden leaved), <i>tenuis</i> (red), <i>pygmæa</i>, and <i>hypnoides</i>
(both dwarf).</p>

<p><i>Dab&oelig;cia polifolia</i> (St. Dabeoc's Heath) is a lovely
little shrub, a close relative of the Heaths, and found
wild in the west of Ireland. It grows a little over
1 foot high, and bears bell-shaped flowers rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
abundantly on erect terminal spikes. They are
purple or white, and sometimes have both colours
in one flower, and the plants continue to produce
them from July or August till the frosts come. It is
quite as plentiful as the dwarf Heaths. <i>Alba</i> is a
white variety. <i>Menziesia polifolia</i> is its former name,
and is still found under that title in books.</p>

<p>The three most suitable Heaths for limestone are
<i>Erica carnea</i>, <i>vagans</i>, and <i>mediterranea</i>.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">NATIVE AND OTHER HARDY EVERGREENS</h3>


<p>Rambling about the country in winter, one becomes
more and more impressed with the beauty of our
native evergreen trees and shrubs. Seven names
comprise them all&mdash;Yew, Holly, Scotch Fir, Spruce,
Juniper, Box, and Ivy. Even of these the Scotch
and Spruce Firs (commonly so-called, though the
Scotch is a Pine) are doubtful natives, though so
long acclimatised that they may be classed with our
own. Those who are laying out new grounds on a
large scale would do well to plant these grand things
in plenty; indeed, in the case of any new planting
that is taken in hand, unless the owner has a good
knowledge of shrubs and some taste in their choice
and disposition, a planting of these alone would save
him from many a regrettable mistake, and from the
prospect of the usual senseless jumble of mixed
shrubbery that has hopelessly spoilt thousands of
gardens.</p>

<p>No foreign shrubs can compare with or take the
place of our Yews and Hollies. However large
a collection of exotics may be in a well-stocked
arboretum, a winter walk among them only shows
that there is nothing more cheerfully handsome than
our Hollies, or more solemnly dignified than our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Yews. On dry, sandy soils no Conifer is better for
England than the Scotch Fir; or for moist, loamy
regions and valley bottoms none is better than the
Spruce. Exception is sometimes taken to the
Spruce; and when planted in other than the place
it likes it is, indeed, a wretched object, as on dry
and hilly grounds. But a mass of Common Spruce
in a cool, alluvial bottom is a picture of well-being,
and no one can deny their majesty on alpine hillsides.
The Douglas Fir is sometimes recommended
in its stead, but this beautiful and quick-growing tree
must still be regarded as an experiment. There is
not as yet a single old Douglas Fir, and there are
some among our botanical experts who are yet in
doubt whether, for all its young vigour, it will be
a lasting tree for our country. For dry uplands
in light soil there is the lovely Juniper, best of all
its kind (though often in nurseries foreign ones only
are offered to its exclusion), and for chalky soils and
loams the Box luxuriates, and can be used as a small
tree, as well as in its usual bush form.</p>

<p>The use of Common Ivy should not be forgotten.
Tree or bush ivies are amongst the most beautiful
and effective of winter plants, all flowering from
October to January. A noble evergreen is the tree
form of <i>Ivy amurensis</i>.</p>

<p>In Ireland we have the Arbutus <i>Unedo</i>, and <i>A.

<p><span class="smcap">Importance of a Suitable Climate.</span>&mdash;Evergreen
shrubs luxuriate generally in the climate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of the British Isles, especially in the southern and
western counties, and constitute one of the great
glories of the English garden, delighting in these
sea-bound islands, with their cool and moist atmosphere.</p>

<p>It has been established, therefore, that the evergreen
seeks an equable climate, free from extremes
of cold and heat, and with an even supply of moisture
to both leaf and root, favouring in a marked
degree the sea-coast with its salt-laden winds. As
we travel south, so opportunities for growing an
increasing variety of evergreen trees and shrubs
become more apparent, until, in the south of Cornwall
and the south-west of Ireland, things may be
planted out with safety which towards the midlands
and north would scarcely exist. But latitude is not
everything, and easily proved so by the rude vigour
of plants from New Zealand and the Himalayas
that are happy in the north of Scotland, but failures
in the midlands and further south of England,
requiring the protection of glass to develop their
characteristic beauty.</p>

<p>The place for the tender evergreens must be protected
from dry north and east winds. Mr. Bean
writes me: "One of the most striking examples I
have met with of the importance of having a situation
such as is described is the Duchess' garden at
Belvoir Castle. Belvoir is in the eastern midlands,
a district where the average temperature is certainly
not high, and where, during my stay there, the thermometer
fell on more than one occasion to zero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
(Fahr.). Yet in this particular spot (known as the
Duchess' garden) there were fine specimens of
Himalayan Rhododendrons&mdash;one of <i>R. Falconeri</i>
being especially noteworthy for the way it grew and
flowered&mdash;an <i>Azara microphylla</i>, 16 feet high, and
other similar examples. The explanation of these
successes, I believe, is entirely in the situation and
exposure of the garden. It was formed on the slope
of a rather steep hill, and is in the shape of an
amphitheatre opening freely to the south. The bitter
'north-easter' loses much of its sting before it
reaches the plants in this garden. In most gardens
it is, of course, impossible to obtain sites so favourable
as this. One has to make the best of what
exists. But at the same time it shows the desirability,
often the necessity, of choosing positions for the
tenderer evergreens in which this need of shelter
is satisfactorily met. Bamboos, Camellias, many
Rhododendrons, Elæagnus, all afford striking examples
of the value of a shelter belt on the north
and east sides." A cool, moist soil is generally
necessary for evergreen shrubs, and we know this to
be true from the distress shown by many kinds
during a dry and parching summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Time to Transplant.</span>&mdash;Early autumn, but
much depends upon the previous weather. It
often happens that evergreens cannot be lifted
through a dry soil. The same trees after winter
rains may be moved with ease and safety in
April or May. An evergreen should be disturbed
whilst the roots are active, and by doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
this in September the shrub can establish itself
before winter&mdash;hence the object of waiting until late
spring, when autumn has been missed, as root
growth has again begun. Autumn is a season
generally of much atmospheric moisture, grateful
dews, and welcome rains. It is the season for
planting in general, and seldom is the work seriously
disturbed until Christmas is past. We have shifted
many evergreens without one failure in April and
quite late in May, but our anxieties are great when
the life-giving rains refuse to refresh the earth. The
spring of 1901 will never be forgotten as a season of
dry winds and brilliant sunshine, without rain to
temper the unfortunate conditions, and the result
was a great loss amongst newly planted evergreens.
Mr. Bean says: "Some evergreens can with reasonable
care be moved with perfect safety at any time,
except perhaps from July to September. Rhododendrons
are an example. During the last ten years
I have transplanted them in every month of the year,
except July and August. Indeed, in the case of Rhododendrons
and most evergreen ericaceous plants,
the problems of transplanting scarcely arise, simply
because the fine fibres hold the soil so completely
that the root system can, with due care, be removed
practically intact. For the same reasons, very
careful transplanting, such as is practised with a
transplanting machine, may also be done at almost
any season.</p>

<p>"When the roots of large evergreen shrubs have
been unavoidably damaged, it is often a good plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
to remove a portion of the leafy branches. This
helps to restore, in some measure, the balance
between root and top. The shrub will frequently
do this itself. Hollies, for instance, often lose a
large proportion of their leaves after transplanting
in spring; it is one of the surest signs of success,
just as the <i>shrivelling</i> of the leaves on the branches
is the worst. Evergreen oaks also furnish other
examples." A difference of opinion exists as to removing
any of the leafy branches. A great authority
writes me: "Keep on all the foliage you can.
I have seen this succeed with large deciduous
trees."</p>

<p>Remember that Evergreen oaks planted in late
spring or in summer should receive a thorough soaking
of water once, then no more until new growth
begins. <i>Syringe freely three times a day in hot weather.</i>
I once saw a yew hedge that had been planted in
mid-winter, the wrong time; it was looking rather
brown through exposure to March winds. The time
I refer to (April) a man was pouring water into the
roots and the result was that nearly all these fine
plants died. Had he damped the foliage twice or
thrice a day instead they would have all lived. It
is important in the case of newly planted yew and
holly hedges to protect by screens of spruce boughs
secured to a hurdle or any other material suitable at
hand to assist the plants until they have started into
growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pruning.</span>&mdash;This is a great advantage to all
Evergreens in moderation; the majority, if left to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
their own will, become straggling in growth and
unsightly.</p>

<p>Evergreens differ from deciduous plants in regard
to time of pruning. Most deciduous things may be
pruned at any time between the fall of the leaf and
the recommencement of growth in spring. But evergreens
should never be pruned in late autumn or
winter. For plants that are grown merely for foliage
sake and not for the flowers, pruning should be done
just as new growth is commencing. In the case of
flowering shrubs like Rhododendron or Berberis it
should be done as soon as the flowering season
is past.</p>

<p>Rhododendrons are improved by pruning, but the
pruner must know something of the varieties and
their growth. <i>Berberis stenophylla</i> gains in beauty by
severe pruning, thinning out and cutting back after
flowering is over. It helps the plant to make those
long, drooping growths which are so beautiful in
spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Climbing Evergreens.</span>&mdash;One of the peculiarities
of the evergreen class of plants is the marked
absence of climbing species in cool temperate countries&mdash;that
is, true climbers, not, the numerous
things that are made to do duty as such on
walls. If one takes up a tree and shrub catalogue
of even the best nurserymen, one is struck by the
few evergreen climbers offered. In spite of the
fact that the cool, temperate regions of the earth
have been so thoroughly ransacked during the last
century, no plant has ever been found that equals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
or even approaches in value the Common Ivy and its
varieties for the special purposes for which they are
adapted. The best that are available are the Jasmine,
<i>Ercilla volubilis</i> (<i>Bridgesia spicata</i>), Smilax, <i>Clematis
calycina</i>, and tenderer things like Lardizabala and
<i>Passiflora cærulea</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">WEEPING HOLLY ON LAWN.</p>

<p>Evergreens as a whole are much neglected in
ordinary gardens. Instead of drawing upon the
great wealth of shrubs available, so many go on
using the same old things over and over again,
generally Aucuba, Portugal and Cherry Laurels,
<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>, and such like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Holly</span> is one of the most beautiful of all
evergreen shrubs, and many varieties are not known,
<i>Ilex Wilsoni</i>, for example, and <i>Laurifolia nova</i> (<i>Camelliæfolia</i>)
which is very distinct from the former. The
best of the Hollies, <i>Hodginsii</i> (syn. <i>Shepherdii</i>), <i>Marnockii</i>,
<i>Hendersonii</i>, <i>platyphylla</i>, <i>fructu-luteo</i> (yellow-berried),
<i>Handsworthensis</i>, <i>Laurifolia</i>, <i>Maderensis atrovirens</i>, which
are all green-leaved varieties. Of variegated varieties,
very beautiful are Golden Queen and Silver Queen,
Handsworth Silver, <i>Argentea marginata</i>, and Mme.
Briot. <i>Watereriana</i> (Waterer's dwarf golden) makes
an excellent little bush, with smooth leaves blotched

<h3 class="gap2">SHRUBS FOR SMALL GARDENS</h3>


<p>It is possible in small gardens to grow many
beautiful shrubs without constant cutting of the
branches to keep them within set bounds. Those
mentioned in the following list will grow in ordinary
soil. Transplant during late autumn and early
winter; and one golden rule to observe in the case
of shrubs obtained from nurseries is to plant them
in their permanent position as soon as possible after
they are received, but should anything occur to
prevent this, the roots must be well covered with
soil till planting takes place. In winter large numbers
of plants are sold at auction rooms, but though they
may appear cheap, this is not always so, as there is
no guide to the length of time they have been out
of the ground, and in a dry atmosphere many of
the smaller roots may have perished. Such plants
take a long time to recover from the check. If
trees or shrubs are bought at a local nursery, there
is the great advantage of getting them in the ground
again as soon as possible. The shrubs named are
fully described elsewhere in this book.</p>


<p><i>Aucubas</i>, 3 to 6 feet. Evergreen shrubs, some
with variegated, others with plain green leaves. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
male and female forms are separate. If the latter
are fertilised, bright-red berries result.</p>

<p><i>Azaleas</i>, 3 to 6 feet. For moist and peaty soil.</p>

<p><i>Berberis Aquifolium</i>, 4 feet; <i>B. Darwinii</i>, 6 to 8 feet;
<i>B. stenophylla</i>, 6 to 8 feet; <i>B. Thunbergi</i>, 2 to 3 feet;
<i>B. vulgaris purpurea</i>, 5 to 6 feet (a purple-leaved
variety of the Common Barberry).</p>

<p><i>Cornus Spaethii</i>, 4 feet. This has rich golden foliage.</p>

<p><i>Cotoneaster frigida</i>, 12 to 15 feet. A sturdy tree,
with scarlet berries in autumn. <i>C. horizontalis</i>, 2 feet;
<i>C. microphylla</i>, 3 feet; <i>C. Simonsii</i>, 5 to 8 feet.</p>

<p><i>Cratægus Oxyacantha</i> (Common Hawthorn). As a
small tree this is delightful in small gardens, especially
the double-flowered forms, of which the richest in
colour is Paul's double crimson. As a contrast to
this there is the double white.</p>

<p><i>Cytisus albus</i> (White Broom), 6 feet; <i>C. nigricans</i>,
4 feet; <i>C. præcox</i> (Sulphur Broom), <i>C. scoparius</i>
(Common Broom), 6 feet; <i>C. s. andreanus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Daphne Cneorum</i> (Garland Flower), 1 foot; <i>D. Mezereum</i>
(the Mezereon), and the white variety <i>alba</i>.</p>

<p><i>Deutzia crenata fl. pl.</i>, 6 to 8 feet; <i>D. gracilis</i>,
<i>D. hybrida</i>.</p>

<p><i>Elæagnus pungens</i>, 6 feet. This is not so much
planted as it should be; it is a rounded evergreen
bush of great charm; flowers fragrant, November
and December. There is a good variegated variety.</p>

<p><i>Euonymus japonicus</i>, 4 to 8 feet; <i>E. radicans</i>, 1&frac12; feet.
The variegated variety is very popular.</p>

<p><i>Forsythia suspensa</i>, 6 to 8 feet. A climbing shrub,
but may be kept in bush form if pruned back hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
after flowering. A mass of golden-yellow flowers
in March or April.</p>

<p><i>Genista hispanica</i> (Spanish Furze), 2 feet; <i>G. sagittalis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hamamelis arborea</i> (Japanese Witch Hazel), 6 to 10
feet; <i>H. zuccariniana</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hedera</i> (Ivy). It must not be forgotten that several
varieties form bushes. These are known as Tree
Ivies, and are invaluable in shady spots.</p>

feet; <i>H. paniculata grandiflora</i>, 4 to 8 feet. Pruned
back hard before starting into growth in spring, this
can be kept dwarf, and if liquid manure is given the
heads of creamy-white flowers in early autumn are
very fine.</p>

<p><i>Hypericum calycinum</i> (Rose of Sharon), 1 foot.
Grows well under trees. <i>H. moserianum</i>, 2 feet.</p>

<p><i>Ilex Aquifolium</i> (Common Holly). A familiar and
handsome evergreen tree. The best variegated

Silver Queen. <i>I. crenata</i> (Japanese Holly).</p>

<p><i>Jasminum nudiflorum</i> (Winter-flowered Jasmine),
Common White Jasmine. Both for walls or to ramble
over some support.</p>

<p><i>Kerria japonica</i>, 5 feet. This little-known shrub
should be more grown; its yellow flowers are small
but pretty. <i>Flore-pleno</i> is a popular variety.</p>

<p><i>Laburnum.</i></p>

and will thrive under trees better than most shrubby
plants. The pretty blue flowers appear for a long
time. There is a variety with prettily variegated
leaves. <i>V. minor</i>, another species, is smaller altogether.
There are deep-blue and white varieties.</p>

<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Shrubs for Town Gardens</h3>

<p>From the preceding list of shrubs for small gardens
a selection suitable for towns is appended. Many
things refuse to live in the smoky and confined air
of towns. This is particularly noticeable in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of evergreens; the pores become choked with sooty
deposit, and the plant consequently soon fails,
whereas many of those whose leaves are removed
annually are not so seriously affected. Conifers are

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">SHRUB AND FLOWER BORDERS</h3>


<p>Where there are wide lawn spaces and fine trees
in garden ground much of the effect is often lost or
spoiled by the presence of unworthy trivialities where
there should be distinct and bold features. The
most frequent offender is a narrow strip of flower
border, edging shrubbery and coming between the
shrubs and the grass. Nothing is more useless than
such a border. The shrubs would look much better
coming right down to the grass, while if bright or
distinct colour is absolutely required, it is easy to
make a place here and there where some patch of
Lily or other flower of bold form may be well seen.</p>

<p>These narrow borders are undesirable, not only
for their poor effect&mdash;we think not of one, but of
many a fine place where there are furlongs of such
futility&mdash;but because the plan is destructive to both
shrubs and flowers. If the ground is not dug for
a year the roots of the shrubs invade it; if it is
dug and enriched for the flowers, the feeding roots
of the shrubs are mutilated.</p>

<p>In the case of a place where lawn comes up to
shrub plantation, which, again, is backed by woodland,
the better way is to have, in just the right places,
a bold planting of something fairly large, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
flower shall endure for a good while, to let the large
group of it come right through to the lawn, and
also stretch away back into the woodland. In our
southern counties, in sheltered places, where the
ground is cool and moist, and at the same time
well drained, nothing can be better than Hydrangeas.
Other softer plants for the same treatment would be
the fine <i>Nicotiana sylvestris</i>, and for earlier in the
year White Foxglove, and even before that <i>Verbascum
olympicum</i>. <i>Lilium auratum</i> is also superb in such
places, and <i>Polygonum Sieboldi</i> and others of this fine
race of autumn-blooming plants. If some of the
shrubs at the edge of the grass, such as Azaleas, have
beautiful colour at more than one time of the year,
both at the flowering time and in autumn blaze of
foliage, two seasons of beauty are secured.</p>

<p>Hardy Ferns are undeservedly neglected as plants
to group about the feet of shrubs; some of the
bolder kinds, as the Male Fern and the Lady Fern,
are charming as a setting to the Lilies that love cool,
shady wood edges.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 157px;"><a id="image0066" name="image0066" href="images/illus0349.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0349th.jpg" width="157" height="214" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">TALL EVERGREEN SHRUBS IN A FLOWER BORDER.</p>

<p>If shrubbery edges were planned with a view to
good effect both far and near, what capital companies
of plants could be put together. As one
such example, let us suppose a cool spot, with peaty
or light vegetable soil, planted in the front with
<i>Skimmia</i> and hardy Ferns, <i>Funkia grandiflora</i>, and
<i>Lilium rubellum</i>. A little farther back would come
<i>Lilium Brownii</i>, then a group of <i>Kalmias</i> and <i>Lilium
auratum</i>. One carefully-planted scheme such as this
would lead to others of the same class, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
quantities of grand shrubs and plants that are only
waiting to be well used would be made into lovely
pictures, instead of being planted in the usual unthinking
fashion, which is without definite aim, and
therefore cannot possibly make any good effect.</p>

<p>We do not, as a rule, plant upright-growing
Conifers of the Juniper and Cypress class in our
flower borders, and yet the illustration shows how
this may be done with the very happiest effect. Probably
in this case the trees were there already, and the
flower border was wanted, and therefore was made
in circumstances that would not have been specially
arranged at the outset. But it has been done with
rare intelligence and sympathy, and the result is
excellent. Here also is seen the best kind of edge
treatment, for the grass is either cut with the scythe
or the plants at the edge are lifted with a stick as
the machine runs along, so that the usual pitiless
machine edge is not seen, and the plants at the side
bush out over the grass just as they should do. This
is a thing that is rarely seen well done in gardens.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">SHRUBS UNDER TREES</h3>


<p>It is often a vexed question what to plant under
trees when the space is bare, and sometimes there
is an ugly view seen beneath the branches to shut
out. Evergreens are the sheet anchor, relieved with
a few deciduous shrubs grouped amongst them.</p>

<p>Much depends upon the tree, whether a Beech
or an Oak, a Maple or a Chestnut, and so on, as
trees vary considerably in their method of rooting,
as well as in the shade they give during the summer
months. This affects the welfare of the plants underneath.
Such trees as Oak, Ash, Plane, Birch, and
Horse Chestnut are inclined to root deeply when
they have grown to a fair size, and do not interfere
directly with anything underneath them, although
the roots extract much moisture from the soil.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Beech, Elm, Lime, and
Sycamore are more surface-rooting, and their roots
often get entangled with and gradually kill plants
growing near them. Beech and Elm are the greatest
offenders, and grass frequently perishes under these
trees. A few liberal soakings of water in dry weather
are beneficial to shrubs or anything else under trees,
but the soakings must be thorough, as mere sprinkles
are more harmful than otherwise. The spread of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
large tree branches should also be noticed in summer,
as sometimes one or two of the lower ones may be
removed with benefit to the shrubs, judicious cutting
away letting in light and air.</p>

<p>The best of the larger growing evergreens to use
under trees are Laurels, both common and Portugal,
Yews, Box, Osmanthus, Aucubas, Phillyræas, common
and oval-leaved Privet, <i>Ligustrum sinense</i>, and
<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>. Of these Yews, Box, and
Osmanthus are perhaps as successful as any. The
Osmanthus is not usually considered suitable for this
purpose, but it succeeds well in the shade, and keeps
a good dark-green colour. Hollies are sometimes
recommended, but, though they may occasionally
thrive under trees, it is not advisable to use many
of them, as they are more often a failure, becoming
thin and straggling in the course of a year or two.
Of dwarf-growing evergreens <i>Berberis Aquifolium</i>,
Butcher's Broom (<i>Ruscus aculeatus</i> and <i>R. Hypoglossum</i>),
<i>Cotoneaster microphylla</i>, <i>Euonymus japonicus</i>, and <i>E. radicans</i>,
with their respective varieties, Skimmias, <i>Gaultheria
Shallon</i>, Ivies, especially the common English,
Irish Ivy, and Emerald green, <i>Pernettya mucronata</i>,
St. John's Wort (<i>Hypericum calycinum</i>), and Vincas
can all be recommended, as they all do well in the
shade, and most of them will flower freely.</p>

<p>For a very dry spot where nothing else will grow
the Butcher's Broom and St. John's Wort should be
planted, as both will grow and thrive where other
plants die. With deciduous shrubs under trees the
difficulty is not so much in getting them to live as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
in coaxing them to flower, but a few of them will
do well in the shade, and, as a rule, bloom freely.
Of these the best are the common and White Brooms,
<i>Azalea pontica</i>, <i>Genista virgata</i>, <i>Philadelphus</i>, Forsythias,
and <i>Daphne Mezereum</i>. The shrubby Spiræas may
also be used sparingly in a fairly light and open
place, though plenty of sun is required as a rule
to enable them to flower properly. In addition,
though their flowers are insignificant, <i>Cornus alba</i>
with its red stems in winter, the Snowberry (<i>Symphoricarpus
racemosus</i>), which is laden every year with
white berries long after the leaves have fallen.</p>

<p>The question about shrubs growing under trees
is so frequently asked that the names of those most
successful are given, but generally the beauty of the
tree is lost when smothered up with evergreens and
other shrubs beneath its spreading branches. A tree
is a picture in itself, and it is pleasant to see the
grass creep to the branch edge and then cease, leaving
a brown earth patch under the canopy of foliage.</p>

<p>Shepherdi Holly, Tree Ivies, and <i>Berberis stenophylla</i>,
it may be mentioned, are a success under trees.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">HARDY SHRUBS IN THE GREENHOUSE</h3>


<p>Hardy shrubs have for many years brought colour
and fragrance to the greenhouse in the depth of
winter, but we think it is only within recent years
that they have been used in such beautiful variety
as at the present time. The great show of the
Royal Horticultural Society in the Temple Gardens,
and many of the delightful fortnightly displays,
have been responsible for much of their present
popularity, and the picture of a group of Plums,
Peaches, Almonds, Wistarias, and many other things
in flower long before their natural season, is refreshingly
pleasant when perhaps winter still lingers.</p>

<p>So many shrub families may be used for gently
forcing into bloom before their time that it is impossible
to lay down hard and fast rules with regard
to culture. In some cases the plants may be lifted
in the autumn, then potted, and placed out of doors
until they are removed under glass, when the flowers
will open in profusion; but the shrubs that can be
treated in this way make dense, fibrous masses of
roots, therefore scarcely feel the check of removal.
Some shrubs, however, transplant so badly that it
is needful to grow them entirely in pots.</p>

<p>Shrubs for flowering under glass are grown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
large quantities by the English nurserymen, and
very beautiful they are when in flower, bringing
the beauty of early summer to the opening days
of spring. Many grow their plants in pots, the
general method being what may be regarded as
a modification of pot culture and planting out,
that is to say, although the plants are potted,
and that in fairly large pots, they are plunged in
the open ground over the rim of the pot, and in
a position fully exposed to air and sunshine. Although
a few roots may be pushed out over the rim,
and also through the hole in the bottom, this treatment
has the effect of keeping them far more
compact than would otherwise be the case, hence
the check of removal is not so great as if they have
unlimited room. This partial confinement of the
roots checks a too luxuriant growth and promotes
flower-bud formation.</p>

<p>In the cultivation of shrubs for this purpose,
whether they are confined in pots or planted out,
choose an open, well-exposed position, carefully
guarding against overcrowding, as this tends to leaves
instead of flowers. With the same object, they must
be kept free from weeds, and not allowed to suffer
from drought.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, the best time to lift and pot
the plants is as soon as possible after the leaves
have fallen in the autumn. When done at this time
the young roots recover from the check, and get
hold of the new soil before the flowering season.
The pots must be plunged in leaves, spent hops, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
cocoa-nut refuse, to keep them in an even condition
of moisture, and after potting never allow the roots
to suffer through dryness. Whether intended for
very early flowering or later on, the plants should
at first only be taken into a comparatively cool
structure, and, if necessary, brought to a greater
heat by degrees, and the lower the temperature, say
about 55 degrees, the more beautiful the flower
colouring; while, when they are only required in
bloom a little before the natural season, mere
protection from sharp frosts and keen winds is
alone essential. The advantage of early potting
is shown conspicuously in the case of Azaleas. The
flowers produced by plants that have been potted
soon after the leaves have fallen will remain twice
as long in beauty as on those not potted until after
Christmas.</p>

<p>In a general way, plants that have been forced
hard to get them into flower early cannot be depended
upon to bloom satisfactorily the following
season, no matter how carefully they may have been
treated, but those merely brought into bloom a little
in advance of those out of doors will undergo the
same ordeal next year. Too often, when the flowers
are over, the shrubs are put away in some corner
and forgotten, and the result is injured leaves and
general upset. Shrubs so treated cannot perform
their duties in the year following. Shrubs that have
finished flowering under glass before the time of
frost and cold winds is past should be at first
carefully protected and gradually hardened off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Where a cool house is not available, a frame in a
sheltered position is suitable, but even then avoid
overcrowding. By the middle of May this precaution
is not so necessary, although keen frosts and winds
are experienced that would injure foliage developed
under glass. Where potting is necessary, that is, in
the case of plants grown permanently in this way,
it should be done before they are placed in their
summer quarters. For this the pots should, if
possible, be placed on a firm bed of ashes and
plunged in some moisture-holding material, such as
partially decayed leaves, spent hops, or cocoa-nut
fibre refuse. Occasional doses of liquid manure
during the growing season are beneficial, particularly
in the case of shrubs that have not been re-potted,
as the limited amount of nourishment in the soil
will have gone by that time.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the best shrubs for
flowering under glass:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andromeda</span> (known also as Pieris and Zenobia).&mdash;The
Andromedas are beautiful shrubs, with lily-of-the-valley-like
flowers, and form such a mass
of fibrous roots that they can be lifted from the open
ground and potted without receiving any check.
When placed in a cool house they flower profusely.
The best are <i>A. floribunda</i>, which has crowded, somewhat
stiff spikes; <i>A. japonica</i>, known by its drooping
racemes; and <i>A. speciosa pulverulenta</i>, which has hoary
leaves and waxy-white bells. The first two may be
had in flower by the end of March, but the other
is later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Azalea.</span>&mdash;One of the useful classes of shrubs that
we have for this purpose, quite as valuable for hard
forcing as for flowering later in spring. Although
the formation of the roots is dense and wig-like,
they are, as already stated, all the better for being
potted early, while they may be permanently grown
in pots in a satisfactory way. The Chinese <i>A.
sinensis</i>, or <i>mollis</i>, as it is more popularly called, is
of close and compact growth, with massive clusters
of large flowers, varying in colour from pale yellow
to deep orange salmon, and innumerable tints and
shades. Among the most beautiful are Alphonse
Lavallé, bright orange; Anthony Koster, deep yellow;
Dr. Pasteur, orange red; General Vetten, orange;
Hugo Koster, salmon red; and J. J. de Vink, soft
rose. The varieties grouped under the head of
Ghent Azaleas are very beautiful, and quite as suitable
for forcing as the preceding. The individual flowers
are smaller, but they are borne in such profusion
that the whole plant is a mound of blossom. The
colour varies from white, through all shades of yellow,
orange, pink, rose, and scarlet, to bright crimson,
so that plenty of variety is available, and some forms
have double flowers. These are not so showy as
the single Azaleas. Azaleas, when planted out, require
a certain amount of peat or other vegetable
matter in the soil, and this is even more important
when they are grown in pots. A suitable compost
consists of equal parts of loam, leaf-mould, and peat,
with half a part of sand. Very little pruning is
needful, and this to consist only of shortening an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
occasional shoot that threatens to upset the balance
of the plant, and thinning wiry and exhausted growths;
but remove seed pods directly the flowers are over,
as these are a drain upon the plant's strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberis.</span>&mdash;Few Berberises are of much account
for greenhouse decoration, the best being the orange-flowered
<i>B. Darwinii</i> and the rich yellow <i>B. stenophylla</i>.
They will not flower well if forced hard, but in a
cool house, with very little heat, they are very charming.
A successful grower of shrubs under glass
writes: "I knew of some bushes of <i>B. stenophylla</i>
that had been treated in this way for five years, and
little trouble was taken with them, yet they were so
beautiful as to be much admired every year. After
flowering, the weakly growths were cut out and the
pots plunged in the open ground. Manure water was
occasionally given, and with this treatment they did
well."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpenteria californica.</span>&mdash;This evergreen shrub,
even in the south of England, is all the better for
slight protection, and it is delightful in the almost
cold house, the white flowers, reminding one of
those of the Japanese anemone, appearing about
May. It is a very beautiful shrub.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caryopteris Mastacanthus.</span>&mdash;This Chinese shrub
will bloom freely in light and warm soils, bearing
lavender blue flowers in profusion during the
autumn; indeed, so late that when cold and wet
weather occurs they often fail to expand at all. This
difficulty is overcome when the plants are grown in
pots and taken into the greenhouse for the flowers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
open; it is then very pretty and much liked. After
flowering, the shoots generally die back almost to the
ground, but break up with renewed vigour in spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceanothus.</span>&mdash;Some of the early-flowering Ceanothuses
are very valuable; they may be grown in pots,
and their flowers are of pleasing blue colouring,
which is unusual and therefore welcome. Among
the best for this purpose are <i>C. dentatus</i>, <i>C. papillosus</i>,
and <i>C. veitchianus</i>. Ceanothuses do not transplant
very well, and if intended for flowering in pots
should be lifted in the autumn, potted carefully,
and wintered in a cool house. They may be kept
altogether in pots, giving them much the same
attention during summer as <i>Berberis stenophylla</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cercis Siliquastrum.</span>&mdash;This is the Judas tree,
and as many know, while the leaves are still absent
the stems bear clusters of rosy-purple flowers. It
may be lifted and potted in the autumn or kept
altogether in pots, but on no account indulge in hard
forcing, as it resents this treatment. Well-grown
specimens are very pretty when in flower in late
March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chionanthus.</span>&mdash;There are two species of Chionanthus,
viz. the North American Fringe tree (<i>C.
virginica</i>) and its Japanese representative <i>C. retusus</i>.
They resemble each other very much, but the
American form is the better of the two. The Fringe
trees are very charming when in pots. Prune back
hard after flowering and fully expose to the sun to
ensure plenty of flower buds. A moist soil is
essential.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mexican Orange Flower</span> (<i>Choisya ternata</i>). This
will bear its white fragrant flower clusters in March
in a greenhouse, and a succession is maintained for
some time. It is most satisfactory when grown
altogether in pots and plunged outside during the
summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clematises.</span>&mdash;Of late years the various forms of
Clematis have been grown largely under glass and
used for various purposes, not only in the shape of
large specimens, but in pots five inches in diameter,
the plant being secured to a single stake and carrying
several big showy flowers. Two somewhat new
continental varieties, Marcel Moser and Nelly Moser,
have proved very useful for this treatment. The
plants flowered in small pots are those that are
propagated in the preceding spring and plunged out
of doors during the summer. The Himalayan <i>C.
montana</i> that flowers naturally so early in the season
readily responds to a little heat, and in the greenhouse
in spring it is almost as welcome as the New
Zealand <i>C. indivisa</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clethra.</span>&mdash;Although <i>C. alnifolia</i> does not flower
until the autumn it may be had in bloom in
spring. Of course, it will not be so early as shrubs
that are naturally in beauty in the spring, but in May
its white, fragrant flowers should be seen. It requires
a cool, moist soil and sunshine, while prune moderately
immediately after flowering. Lifted in the
autumn soon after the leaves drop, it will succeed
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corylopsis spicata.</span>&mdash;This reminds one of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
small Hazel bush, and in early spring before the
leaves appear, the drooping clusters of fragrant yellow
flowers appear in profusion; simple protection is all
that is needed to get flowers quite early in the year,
when it is very pretty in the greenhouse. It thrives
well kept permanently in pots, or it may be lifted
and potted in the autumn. No pruning is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cytisus</span> (Broom).&mdash;The various Brooms are much
admired, whether in the open ground or under glass,
and for the latter purpose they must be established
in pots, for their roots are few, descend deeply, and
therefore transplanting is difficult. They will not
bear hard forcing, but in a greenhouse may be had
in flower by the end of March, or soon after. If
kept altogether in pots, cut them hard back after
flowering to encourage vigorous shoots for another
year. Numerous sorts may be grown in pots, particularly
the Spanish Broom (<i>C. albus</i>), the common
Broom (<i>C. scoparius</i>), with the hybrid Andreanus and
the sulphur-coloured <i>C. præcox</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deutzia.</span>&mdash;The pretty <i>D. gracilis</i> is well known as
one of the best of all shrubs for early forcing, and
the whole family is of great interest as pot plants
and out of doors. Of these smaller Deutzias some
beautiful hybrids have been raised, particularly <i>D.
Lemoinei</i>, <i>D. hybrida venusta</i>, and <i>D. kalmæflora</i>, all of
which may be forced almost, if not quite, as readily
as <i>D. gracilis</i>. The old and exhausted shoots of
these Deutzias should, if the shrubs are kept in pots,
be cut away to allow young and vigorous ones to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
develop. Though they may be had in flower early,
they are much appreciated in the greenhouse, even
as late as the month of May. The larger growing
<i>D. crenata</i>, with its numerous varieties, <i>Candidissima
flore-pleno</i>, <i>Wellsii</i>, and <i>Watererii</i> will not bear hard
forcing, but can be had in flower with little trouble
in April and May. Good, well-ripened bushes may
be lifted in the autumn, and if potted and carefully
attended to they will flower well the following
spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diervilla (Weigela).</span>&mdash;Many of the Bush Honeysuckles,
as the Weigelas are called, will flower well in
a cool house, but they do not last sufficiently long in
bloom to make them of great value for this purpose.
The best is the dark-coloured <i>Eva Rathke</i>, which grows
naturally into a neat bush; the flowers are of claret
colouring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heaths.</span>&mdash;<i>Erica carnea</i> is very pretty in a cool house
in mid-winter, all that is needed being to lift the
clumps from the open ground, pot, and keep watered;
while the large-growing Portuguese Heath, <i>E. lusitanica</i>,
which flowers naturally in February in the
open ground, when the weather is not too severe,
well repays glass protection at that season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forsythia.</span>&mdash;The Forsythias flower in the open
ground by the month of March, and indoors, of
course, much earlier. The most effective is <i>F.
suspensa</i>, which is naturally a climber, or, at all
events, of loose and rambling growth. When needed
for pots, tie the principal shoots to a stout stake, and
let the smaller branches grow at will, the result being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
a fountain of yellow flowers. After flowering in the
greenhouse, cut back the shoots hard, leaving only
an eye or two at the base. These eyes will break
up and produce flowering shoots for another year.
By this method of treatment the same plants may
be kept for many years, provided they are carefully
attended to and given occasional doses of liquid
manure during the summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrangea.</span>&mdash;The many varieties of the common
Hydrangea are all valuable for the greenhouse,
particularly <i>Cyanoclada</i>, <i>Mariesii</i>, <i>Rosea</i>, <i>Stellata</i>, and
Thomas Hogg. To obtain small flowering plants
the cuttings are struck in spring or early summer,
grown on freely for a time, and well ripened by full
exposure to air and sunshine before autumn. Plants
grown in this way readily respond to a little heat
in the spring. Larger specimens, too, may be brought
on in the same way. The Japanese <i>H. paniculata
grandiflora</i> needs quite different treatment, the plants
being generally grown in the open ground, from
whence they are lifted and potted in the autumn.
Before potting prune the long, wand-like shoots back
hard, leaving only about two eyes at the base. By
so doing the plants are kept dwarfer, and the flower
heads are larger than if no pruning were done. By
some the Hydrangea is grown as a standard, and
is very effective when in beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Itea virginica</span>.&mdash;A neat little bush, about a yard
high, with dense spikes of white flowers. It needs
a sunny spot in a cool and moist soil, and under
these conditions will flower freely if carefully lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
in the autumn and potted. It must not suffer from
dryness afterwards. No pruning is necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jamesia americana.</span>&mdash;A pretty little white-flowered
shrub from the Rocky Mountains. It will bloom
freely under glass, but must not be forced hard;
it may be treated in the same way as the Itea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kalmia.</span>&mdash;All the Kalmias are good pot shrubs.
The roots are dense and wig-like, reminding one of
those of a Rhododendron, so that well-budded plants
can be lifted in the autumn and potted without
risk. They must be brought on gradually in a cool
house, and never suffer from want of water. The
earliest to bloom is <i>K. glauca</i>, followed by <i>K.
angustifolia</i>, while later on there is the largest and
best-known species, <i>K. latifolia</i>, the Mountain Laurel
of the United States, which has pretty pink flower
clusters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kerria japonica</span> (the Jews' Mallow).&mdash;The single
Kerria is a twiggy bush, with bright yellow flowers,
like those of a single Rose, and expand quickly in
spring. The major form of the double Kerria is
much better than the ordinary one; they can be
potted in autumn or grown permanently in pots.
After the flowering season is over the double variety
can be spurred back hard to prevent a tall weakly
growth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laburnum.</span>&mdash;This has long been used for the
greenhouse, and very effective it is when well
flowered. It is as a rule most successful when in
large pots, in the shape of a standard. Prune
back moderately after flowering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lonicera</span> (Honeysuckle).&mdash;As <i>L. fragrantissima</i>
flowers naturally out of doors soon after Christmas
when the weather is mild, it is evident that no
forcing is needed to obtain it at that season, and in
a cool greenhouse the little white flowers are remarkable
for their delicious perfume. As spring advances
the early Dutch may be flowered under glass, while
the scarlet Honeysuckle (<i>L. sempervirens minor</i>) is a
delightful greenhouse plant, not used so much as it
deserves to be for rafters and similar purposes in the
greenhouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loropetalum chinense.</span>&mdash;This Chinese shrub,
with its long, pure white, strap-shaped petals, bears
much resemblance to the Chionanthus, and is quite
as desirable for flowering in pots. It may be either
lifted in the autumn or grown altogether in pots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnolia.</span>&mdash;The Magnolias can be grown under
glass. If allowed to come gradually into bloom in a
greenhouse the large flowers will open freely. As a
rule they transplant badly, and for that reason, at
least the choicer ones, are kept in pots for convenience
in removal. From this it will be understood
that as a rule it is more satisfactory to keep them
permanently in pots than to lift them in the autumn.
<i>M. purpurea</i> can be grown more easily than any of the
others in this form. When grown in pots for the
greenhouse, if they get too large for that structure
they may be planted permanently out of doors and
their place taken by smaller plants. Of those particularly
valuable for this treatment are the little <i>M.
stellata</i>, a charming shrub; <i>M. Lenné</i>, which has massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
chalice-like flowers, rosy-purple outside; <i>M. conspicua</i>,
<i>M. soulangeana</i>, and <i>M. purpurea</i> among the early
Magnolias; and of those that flower later the Japanese
<i>M. parviflora</i> and <i>M. Watsoni</i> do well in pots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olearia.</span>&mdash;The best known of the Daisy trees of
New Zealand is <i>O. Haastii</i>, which flowers freely in
August. One at least of the species blooms naturally
much earlier, namely <i>O. stellulata</i> (<i>O. gunniana</i>), and
very pretty it is under cover and with its daisy-like
blossom. To be seen at their best, grow them
altogether in pots and give the protection of a cool
house in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tree Pæonies.</span>&mdash;The magnificent varieties of the
Tree Pæony that have appeared in recent years have
led to a great increase in their culture. Though
hardy in many places, their young leaves and flowers
are frequently injured by late frosts, hence they
are often flowered under glass. In this way they
make a gorgeous display in the greenhouse, which is
sufficiently warm for them in all stages. If forcing
is attempted they are quickly spoilt. They must be
potted in good loamy soil, and are most satisfactory
when grown altogether in pots, as many of the long
fleshy roots will be injured in digging up established
plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pernettya mucronata.</span>&mdash;Though grown chiefly
for its ornamental berries, neat little bushes are very
pleasing in the greenhouse when thickly studded
with little white lily-of-the-valley-like flowers, so
pretty against the dark-green colouring of the
leaves. The treatment recommended for Kalmias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
is suitable for the Pernettyas. The fruits are very
charming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphus</span> (Mock Orange).&mdash;This in its several
forms may be lifted in the autumn and flowered well
the following spring, not early, as the forcing must
be very gentle. Even then the perfume of <i>P.
coronarius</i> is too powerful to be pleasant in a confined
space. This objection cannot, however, be urged
against M. Lemoine's hybrids between this species
and the pretty little Mexican <i>P. microphyllus</i>, which has
a fragrance like that of ripe apples. These newer
hybrids&mdash;<i>Avalanche</i>, <i>Boule d'Argent</i>, <i>Gerbe de Neige</i>,
<i>Manteau d'Hermine</i>, <i>Mont Blanc</i>, and <i>Lemoinei</i>&mdash;are
all worth a place either in the open ground or for
flowering in pots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prunus.</span>&mdash;Several classes that were at one time
considered as separate genera are now included in
the genus Prunus, which was formerly limited to the
Plum family. Now the Cherries, Almonds, and
Peaches are only sections of the genus Prunus, as
explained elsewhere in this book, but as they are
better known under their respective names it will be
wiser to refer to them thus. The Cherries (<i>Cerasus</i>)
have been added to considerably of recent years,
several varieties having come from Japan, mostly of
<i>P. (Cerasus) pseudo-cerasus</i>. These, which include
such varieties as <i>Sieboldi</i>, <i>Watereri</i>, and J. H. Veitch,
all flower freely when quite small, an important point
when considering plants needed for flowering under
glass. Where larger plants are required the double
form of the Wild Cherry (<i>P. Avium</i>) is very beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
The Almonds flower early naturally, and under
glass, of course, earlier still; the variety <i>purpurea</i> is
one of the best, while a distinct species, <i>P. (Amygdalus)
davidiana</i> and its variety <i>alba</i>, are also suitable
for growing under glass. The Peaches (<i>Persica</i>) form
a delightful group, all available for flowering under
glass; indeed, they respond readily to gentle forcing,
hence may be had in bloom by March. There are
several varieties, the flowers ranging in colour from
white, through pink, to crimson, and double as well
as single. One of the finest forms is <i>magnifica</i>, a
Japanese variety, semi-double, and brilliant carmine
crimson in colour. The purple-leaved Peach is very
charming.</p>

<p>Of the true Plums, special mention must be made
of the dark-leaved variety of the Cherry Plum, known
as <i>Prunus Pissardi</i>, of the pretty little <i>P. japonica alba
plena</i>, and <i>japonica rosea plena</i>, more generally known
in gardens as <i>P. sinensis</i>, which has slender shoots,
wreathed for the greater part of their length with
double rosette-like flowers, and the charming pink
semi-double <i>P. triloba</i>. All these forms of Prunus
will, if they have been regularly transplanted, lift well
in the autumn and flower without a check. They are
also quite satisfactory if kept altogether in pots when
spurred back after flowering and encouraged to make
free and well-ripened growth during the summer
months, when they should be plunged out of doors in
a sunny spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pyrus.</span>&mdash;The very beautiful <i>P. floribunda</i> is quite
happy under this treatment, and <i>P.</i> or <i>Cydonia japonica</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
(the Japanese Quince) that flowers early in the year
is pretty under glass, especially the distinct <i>P. Maulei</i>,
which is of dense and compact growth, and bears
salmon-red flowers in profusion. Grow the Pyruses
in a similar way to the Prunuses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphiolepis japonica</span> (<i>R. ovata</i>).&mdash;An evergreen
of sturdy growth, and about 3 feet high, with terminal
spikes of pure white hawthorn-like flowers. It is
decidedly uncommon and ornamental when in bloom.
Out of doors its season is June, but, of course, is
earlier under glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhododendron.</span>&mdash;These are the most gorgeous
of shrubs, and largely used for flowering in pots or
tubs. They form a dense mat of fibres, and can
therefore be lifted with little check. Owing to this
they can, when ordinary care is used, be transferred
to new quarters without losing a leaf, not only when
potted, but also when planted out in the open ground.
Hard forcing must be avoided, but the Rhododendrons
may be brought on gradually in gentle heat.
Under this treatment they must be well supplied
with water, and liberal syringing is also beneficial.
The wide range of colouring in the Rhododendron
family gives an opportunity for getting almost any
shade desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhodotypus kerrioides.</span>&mdash;A beautiful Japanese
shrub, reminding one of a Kerria, but the flowers are
white. It will succeed with the same treatment as
the Kerria requires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ribes</span> (Flowering Currant).&mdash;Both the yellow-flowered
<i>R. aureum</i> and the various forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<i>R. sanguineum</i> can be brought into flower early
under glass, but the flowers do not last long, and
for this reason the shrubs are little used for the
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spiræas.</span>&mdash;An extensive family, some of which
bloom delightfully when lifted and potted in the
autumn and brought into flower in gentle heat.
They may also be grown permanently in pots, but
as a rule autumn potting is preferable. The most
popular is <i>S. confusa</i> or <i>media</i>, but also very charming
are <i>S. arguta</i>, one of the most beautiful of all Spiræas,
<i>S. Van Houttei</i>, <i>S. Thunbergi</i>, and <i>S. prunifolia fl. pl.</i>,
which all bear white flowers, those of the last mentioned
being double.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Staphylea</span> (Bladder Nut).&mdash;<i>S. colchica</i> is most
used for forcing, and is a charming shrub for the
purpose. It quickly responds to heat and moisture.
Brought on in a gentle greenhouse temperature, it
gives a wealth of drooping clusters of white fragrant
flowers. Keep the shrubs in pots, as the buds are produced
more freely than when planting out is done,
and after the flowers are over prune hard back.
There is a hybrid between <i>S. pinnata</i> and <i>S. colchica</i>,
called <i>Columbieri</i>, which is better than <i>S. colchica</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Syringa</span> (Lilac).&mdash;The Lilac is one of the most
popular of shrubs for forcing, and may be had in
bloom by Christmas or soon after, its flowers being
welcome from then until they appear out of doors.
Thousands of plants for flowering under glass are
prepared in the most careful way every year, the
neat bushes, about 2 feet high, having been grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
in pots 7 or 8 inches across and plunged in the
open ground. This treatment results in close and
compact balls of soil, which, when turned out of the
pots, retain their shape and bear the journey well.
These plants are pruned hard back after flowering
to keep them dwarf. Lilacs that have been frequently
moved may be lifted and flowered without risk. Most
of those sent from Holland consist of the white-flowered
variety, <i>Marie Legrange</i>, but the dark-coloured
<i>Charles X.</i> is also grown. The many double-flowered
Lilacs are not so popular as the singles. It is a pure
delight to smell the flowers of the Lilac long before
they appear in the open garden; they are most
welcome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Viburnum.</span>&mdash;When the plants are well budded the
Laurustinus (<i>V. Tinus</i>) will flower throughout the
winter in a greenhouse. Of those that are amenable
to slight forcing the best are the common Guelder
Rose (<i>V. Opulus sterile</i>), the Chinese <i>V. plicatum</i>, and
<i>V. macrocephalum</i>. Treat them in the same way as
the Lilac. The Guelder Rose is a delightful shrub
under glass, with its wealth of ivory-white balls.
It is one of the most interesting of all the things that
can be brought into bloom in a greenhouse. Treat
the Viburnums in the same way as recommended for
the Lilacs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wistaria.</span>&mdash;It is only within the past few years
that the Wistaria has been used to any extent for
flowering in this way, but now it is universally
admired. At the exhibitions early in the year it
always attracts more attention than any other shrub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
grown in a greenhouse; the soft lilac colouring of
the flowers is very beautiful against the tender green
of the expanding leaves. The best and general way
is to grow it as a standard, as the racemes hang
down in graceful profusion. <i>W. sinensis</i> is the Wistaria
planted so freely against houses and pergolas,
and for flowering under glass the variety <i>alba</i>
may be mentioned; it is more satisfactory than in
the open garden. <i>W. multijuga</i>, which has racemes
of great length, may also be tried, but <i>W. sinensis</i> is
as charming as any, and the most likely to give
satisfaction. Wistarias transplant badly, hence in
nurseries are usually kept in pots; therefore, for
flowering under glass, permanent pot culture is the
proper treatment. To obtain standards train up a
single shoot till the required height is reached, then
stop it, and encourage the formation of branches.
When the head has reached flowering size, after the
flowers are over, spur the shoots back to good eyes
to keep the growth fairly compact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Japanese Maples</span> (<i>Acer palmatum</i> and varieties).&mdash;The
handsome foliage of the Japanese Maples forms
their chief charm. When grown under glass they
are very beautiful, the leaves varying greatly both in
colour and shape; some almost plain, others deeply
cut and almost fringe-like.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">SHRUB GROUPS FOR WINTER AND SUMMER
EFFECT</h3>


<p>In the gardens of Lord Aldenham at Elstree an
interesting feature is the grouping of shrubs for
summer and winter effect, and some valuable notes,
contributed to the <i>Garden</i> on this subject, may be
helpful to those desirous of getting the best results
from both tree and shrub:&mdash;</p>

<p>The grouping of suitable subjects, either in the
pleasure-ground proper, on the margin of wood,
lake, and stream, and especially so in the half-wild
garden, when carefully carried out, has such a good
effect at all seasons that it is difficult to understand
why it is not more generally done, for only when
massed together is it possible to see the true beauty
of many of the commoner hardy shrubs. For some
years this way of planting has been practised at
Elstree to a considerable extent, and the following
experience may be helpful to others.</p>

<p>The chief desire here has been to create autumn
and winter effect, and Nature has been of slight
assistance to the planter, as the land is not undulating
but generally flat and uninteresting, consequently
much thought and attention have been
devoted to attaining the desired object. No two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
shrubs grown either for the beauty of their leaves
or bark should be mixed together; the display is
more pleasurable when they are kept apart.</p>

<p>Having determined on the sites to be planted,
use white stakes for marking the outline, and plant
boldly. The ground should be thoroughly trenched,
and poor land well enriched with farmyard manure,
and the planting proceeded with either in spring or
early autumn. This planting will apply to dwarf-growing
subjects. The deciduous section is dealt
with first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aronia floribunda.</span>&mdash;A delightful plant when
grown as a bush, bearing sweetly-scented hawthorn-like
flowers in May, very effective, and succeeded
by a wealth of deep-purple berries in autumn. This
should also receive an annual pruning during winter
or early spring. Allow a distance of 2 feet 6 inches
between the plants, which are well suited for any
purpose. The ground should be kept clean underneath
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberis Thunbergi.</span>&mdash;Few deciduous shrubs
can excel this for its beautiful foliage during autumn,
and it deserves to be planted more extensively. In
no position is it seen to better advantage than when
in large masses over bold pieces of rock. The
shrub should not be pruned, but allowed to retain
its natural habit, and will succeed in almost any
soil. No plant is better adapted for such positions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberis vulgaris purpureis.</span>&mdash;This has deep-purple
foliage of a very pleasing shade, and it bears
bright-scarlet berries in autumn, succeeds best on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
chalky soils, should be cut close to the ground every
third winter, and the soil left undisturbed about
the roots. <i>B. v. foliis-purpureis</i> is remarkable for its
very dark purple leaves throughout the summer.
Cut back every spring; it succeeds in poor ground.
<i>B. aristata</i> is very distinct in winter; bark brownish-red.
<i>B. virescens</i> is another charming winter shrub.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colutea arborescens.</span>&mdash;The Bladder Senna
may be planted in the half-wild garden, and will
succeed in almost any position and in any soil.
Its yellow flowers in July are pretty, but the seed-vessels
during winter are most effective; it should
be pruned back hard annually. There are several
varieties, each of which are equally well adapted
for this purpose. Plant 3 feet apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornus sanguinea</span> (Dogwood).&mdash;Few deciduous
shrubs are more easily grown or more effective
during winter than the Scarlet Dogwood. It may
be grouped in any position either in the gardens or
outside when of any extent, and when space is
no object the beds or groups can hardly be too
large. The foliage attains a beautiful bronze tint
during autumn, but unfortunately soon falls. The
position should be open, and it is absolutely essential
that the growths be cut to the ground annually the
first week in April, bearing in mind that it is only
the young wood which puts on its brightly-coloured
robe in winter, and the more intense the cold the
better colour will be the wood. Plant 3 feet
apart. <i>Cornus sanguinea variegata</i> is a beautiful silver
variegated form of the above, but not so vigorous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
It is very fine for summer decorations, and should
be much more appreciated. Plant at a distance
of 18 inches and prune annually. The scarlet
wood, though small, is very pretty in winter,
but not showy enough in the distance. <i>Cornus
alba Spathi</i> has beautiful golden foliage in the
summer, and does not lose its brightness in the
hottest years. Requires the same treatment as
the above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corylus maxima atropurpurea.</span>&mdash;One of our
best purple-leaved plants, especially so in early
summer. Arrange to plant this near <i>Acer negundo
variegata</i>, <i>Sambucus nigra aurea</i>, or both, and the effect
will be good. It will succeed on almost any kind
of well-trenched ground. Plant the shrubs 3 feet
apart, and they will require little attention, but
every fifth year the shoots should be cut clean to
the ground, when the growth and foliage will be
much more robust and telling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotoneaster Simonsii.</span>&mdash;A strong-growing shrub,
and suitable for making large groups; it is very
effective during autumn and winter when studded
with its red berries. It should be planted 3 feet
apart and not pruned, but about every fifth year it
should be cut close to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cytisus albus</span>, the Common White Broom;
<i>Cytisus scoparius</i>, the Common Yellow Broom; and
the effective although newer variety, <i>C. scoparius</i>,
<i>andreanus</i>, are all delightful plants when extensively
planted, not only when in flower, but their fresh-looking
green wood is pleasing at all seasons. Plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
early in April 3&frac12; feet apart, using small plants.
None of the Brooms like being cut back to the
hard wood, but the young growths may be shortened
back after flowering. <i>C. præcox</i> is perhaps
the best of the whole family, flowering profusely,
and is of good habit. It should be planted 4 feet
apart, and the strong growths pegged down in the
soil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daphne mezereum</span> and the white variety <i>album</i>
are among our earliest and most beautiful flowering
shrubs; <i>Autumnale</i> is excellent, it blooms in late
autumn. They should be planted 4 feet apart, either
immediately after flowering or in very early autumn,
both flourishing best on light soils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dimorphanthus mandschuricus</span> (syn. <i>Aralia
mandschurica</i>).&mdash;This fine tropical-looking plant, when
planted in large beds, forms a magnificent feature
during the summer months, and in the winter the
stems when bare are both curious and interesting.
It enjoys a deep rich soil, and is easily propagated
from root suckers. Plant at a distance of 5 feet
apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Euonymuses.</span>&mdash;The true variety of <i>Euonymus alatus</i>
must rank as one of the most valuable plants for
autumn effect. Words can hardly describe its beautiful
tints. It is a slow grower, but will succeed in almost
any kind of soil. Plant 3 feet apart. <i>E. europæus</i> (the
Spindle tree) should be planted in large beds or masses
at a distance of 4 feet apart, and pruned annually. It
deserves a place by any woodland walk or in the half-wild
garden. Thus treated it will fruit most freely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and its pretty pink berries hanging in thick bunches
are sure to attract attention. The white variety, though
as pretty, does not fruit so freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Forsythia suspensa.</span>&mdash;This is most effective when
planted in any position in the gardens or grounds. It
makes a delightful bed when planted at a distance of
4 feet apart, and should not be pruned. <i>F. viridissima</i>,
though not such a pretty kind as the above, is equally
well suited; it flowers profusely. Both of these flower
during March and April. The surface-soil should be
pricked over every spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fuchsia Riccartoni.</span>&mdash;This charming old shrub
makes magnificent beds in any part of the grounds.
It should be cut down close to the ground every
spring and receive a mulching of half-decayed manure.
This is not planted half so largely as it deserves
to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora.</span>&mdash;This is
perfectly hardy, and few flowering shrubs are more
admired during autumn when in large beds. They
should be planted in a deep rich soil, in a moist
position, 3 feet apart, and pruned back hard annually
at the end of March. We have some which were
planted sixteen years ago and have never once failed
to make a splendid display. The surface-soil should
be pricked over early in spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippophaë rhamnoides</span> (the Sea Buckthorn).&mdash;This
will succeed well in any deep moist soil. Its
beautiful grey foliage shows up well during summer,
and when the male and female plants are mixed
together the branches will be wreathed with clusters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
of beautiful orange-coloured berries during autumn
and winter. Plant 5 feet apart and somewhat in
the background. Very little pruning will be required,
except to regulate the growths. Prick over the surface-soil
annually. The Sea Buckthorn also lends itself
admirably for planting by the sides of lakes and
streams or at the back of rock-work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hypericums.</span>&mdash;<i>H. Androsæmum</i> grows to the height
of 2 feet 6 inches, and is sure to be appreciated. Its
flowers appear profusely during summer, and are followed
by clusters of dark-brown berries. Plant 2 feet
apart and prune close to the ground annually early in
April. <i>H. calycinum</i> (the Common St. John's Wort)
is partly evergreen and admirably suited for clothing
banks or making beds where low-growing subjects
are required; it will flourish anywhere, and should
be cut close to the ground with the shears annually.
<i>H. moserianum</i> is one of the best of this class of plants,
but needs some protection in cold districts. <i>H. patulum</i>
is also an excellent variety, and not so extensively
planted as it deserves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kerria japonica.</span>&mdash;A charming compact-growing
shrub, with single bright-yellow flowers. It is suitable
for small beds or grouping in the front of
shrubberies. There is a variegated variety which
is liable to revert back to the green form, but such
shoots should be kept cut out. Very little if any other
pruning is required; a poor, light, sandy soil suits it
best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leycesteria formosa.</span>&mdash;A delightful shrub for
massing in the wilderness or wild garden; requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
a deep rich soil. Its large purple and white flowers
in August and September are very pleasing, and
during autumn and winter the wood is very conspicuous,
being bright green. It should be pruned
back annually, and the ground pricked over in spring.
Plant at a distance of 4 feet apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lonicera (Honeysuckle), Large Dutch.</span>&mdash;To
see this beautiful climbing plant at its best, make
a mound of tree roots, fill in with soil, and plant
at a distance of 4 feet apart. At first the growths
will require to be trained and nailed over the roots,
and when once covered they will need little other
attention. Large beds planted in this way will be
sure to be highly appreciated, if for nothing else, for
the fragrance of the flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lycium chinense.</span>&mdash;Commonly called Box Thorn
or Tea Tree; should be planted in large groups where
it can ramble away near the water or overhang large
roots of trees or boulders. Except to regulate the
growths once a year, it will give no further trouble.
There are several other varieties well suited for the
same purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pyrus japonica.</span>&mdash;This well-known early-flowering
shrub may be grouped in almost any position, but
is seen to the best advantage when on raised
ground or overhanging masses of rock. It should
not be pruned, but allowed to retain its natural
habit. Plant at a distance of 4 feet apart. The
variety <i>carnea</i> is equally good, but bears more freely;
the fruits make excellent preserve, while the flowers
are a beautiful flesh colour. <i>C. Maulei</i> is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
distinct from the above, but quite as valuable, and
flowers and fruits freely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhus cotinus</span> (Venetian Sumach), the Smoke Plant
or Wig Tree, is one of the most effective shrubs for
this purpose. A large mass of this, with its delightfully-tinted
foliage in autumn, is a pleasing picture,
and is well adapted for any position or any part of
the garden. It should be planted in deep but poor
soil, at a distance of 5 feet apart, and slightly pruned
annually early in April; it requires no other attention.
<i>R. typhina</i> (the Stag's-Horn Sumach) is one
of the commonest plants grown, with not much
beauty, except when planted in large beds and cut
close to the ground annually. When treated in this
way few things are more attractive; it then throws
up strong, vigorous shoots, with fine tropical-looking
foliage, which is highly attractive during summer, and
the colouring of the foliage during autumn is most
conspicuous, also of the wood during winter. When
stripped of its foliage it is distinct and pleasing; it
will flourish in any soil. Plant 3 feet apart, and
it is easily propagated by root suckers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa rugosa.</span>&mdash;This charming Rose, when planted
in the wilderness, wild garden, or around the lake,
in large beds or masses, is always seen to advantage;
it has fragrant flowers in summer, and large,
highly-coloured fruit in autumn. Place it in the forefront
of flowering plants. Plant in deep, well-enriched
soil, at a distance of 4 feet apart, and prune, like other
Roses, annually. The white variety is equally well
adapted, and may be mixed with the above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa Bengale Hermosa</span>, belonging to the monthly
or China section, is one of the freest flowering and
most charming of all Roses. In mild autumns it flowers
freely until Christmas when planted in sheltered positions.
It enjoys a rich soil, and should be pegged
down annually, merely thinning out the growths in
spring. May go in any part of the garden or grounds,
and it is perhaps unequalled for covering southern
slopes. Fellenberg is exceptionally free also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa rubiginosa</span> (the Sweet Briar).&mdash;Every
woodland walk, wilderness, or wild garden should
have one bed or more of this fragrant plant. The
delicious scent emitted from its foliage in spring after
showers is very welcome, and the bushes, when
heavily laden with the bright-red fruits in autumn
and winter, are most effective. This should be
planted at a distance of 3 feet apart in well-trenched
and heavily-manured ground, and clipped over every
spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubus.</span>&mdash;Nearly the whole of these may be freely
grouped. Only those most successful at Elstree are
mentioned: <i>R. biflorus</i> (the white-washed Bramble)
is one of the most distinct and effective of the whole
class. During winter it looks as if it had been painted
white, and when planted close to the Scarlet Dogwood
is exceedingly attractive in the distance. It succeeds
best on a good deep loam, and the old growths should
be cut out every winter. Plant at a distance of 4 feet
apart. <i>R. canadensis rosea</i> (the flowering Raspberry)
is invaluable for making large beds. It continues to
produce its highly-coloured flowers freely all through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the summer and autumn. Plant 3 feet apart and
thin out the old growths annually. <i>R. ulmifolius roseo
flore-pleno</i>, also the white form <i>alba</i> (the double-flowered
Blackberry), may be grouped on slopes. The old
growths should be cut out annually, and plant 4 feet
apart. <i>R. laciniata</i> (American Blackberry) is the best
of the fruiting kinds for this purpose; it produces
large crops of valuable fruit every year. Treat in the
same way as advised for the above. <i>R. ph&oelig;nicolasius</i>
(the Japanese Wineberry). This somewhat new form
of Rubus is one of the best plants for this kind of
planting. It bears freely, and the fruits are much
appreciated by many, and its bright canes during
winter produce a most pleasing effect. It is a strong
grower when planted in good soil at a distance of
5 feet apart. Remove all the old canes during
winter. The ordinary garden forms of Raspberry
also make fine groups in the unkept parts of the
grounds. The old growths should be pruned out
each autumn, when the young canes have a warm
and pleasing appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salix.</span>&mdash;Many of the Willows form splendid
features during the winter months. Perhaps on
a fine winter's day large masses of the highly-coloured
barked Willows can hardly be excelled
for their beauty and rich colouring, but, of course,
are only adapted for waterside planting or low, wet,
marshy land. Nothing is more readily propagated
from cuttings than these. They should be planted
3 feet apart, and the young growths pruned hard
to the ground annually the last week in March, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
it must be borne in mind that any wood more than
twelve months old has very little, if any, beauty in it.
The most important for the beauty of their wood are
<i>Salix vitellina</i>, the golden-barked Willow, <i>S. alba britzensis</i>,
warm, orange-coloured bark, very beautiful,
<i>S. cardinalis</i> (which has bright-red bark), and <i>S.
purpurea</i>, purple. Though the last mentioned is not
so effective in the distance as the foregoing, it is well
worthy of cultivation. Only one other Willow will
be mentioned; it should be planted for its summer
beauty, that is <i>S. rosmarinifolia</i>. Its beautiful grey
foliage much resembles that of Rosemary. It is not
so robust a grower as many of the family, and there
is no beauty in the wood during winter, consequently
the growths should only be shortened back to within
three eyes of the base annually.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sambucus.</span>&mdash;The Elder family, like the preceding,
is a large one, and fortunately adapts itself to almost
any soil and situation. First and foremost must be
mentioned <i>Sambucus nigra aurea</i>, a bold and beautiful
tall-growing Elder, and its rich golden foliage produces
a marvellous effect in the landscape. Large
bold masses of this should always be used where
practical in a half-open position. Hard pruning in
this case must be carried out, cutting the summer's
growth close to the ground annually in the last week
of March. The effect of the greenish-grey wood in
winter when treated in this way is pleasing; the
silvery variegated form, though not so showy, is
worthy of a place where the grounds are extensive.
Should be planted on poor soil in an open position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
and pruned hard annually. <i>S. n. laciniata</i> (the
Parsley-leaved Elder) is a beautiful and distinct
form of the cut-leaved Elder, which attains its true
character and makes splendid beds; it requires the
same kind of treatment as to pruning as the above.
<i>S. racemosa foliis aurea</i> is unquestionably the finest
variety in cultivation, and one would like to see it
more often in our gardens, but there seems to be an
unreasonable prejudice against golden-leaved shrubs,
however beautiful. It does best on a deep rich soil
in a fully-exposed position, and prune back hard early
in April. The cuttings should be propagated in pots
in a cold frame. The whole of the Elders should be
planted 3 feet apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spartium junceum</span> (the Spanish Broom).&mdash;Flowers
in early autumn and lasts a considerable time. Its
bright-yellow blooms are very telling in the distance.
Plant 4 feet apart, and prune after flowering.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;"><a id="image0067" name="image0067" href="images/illus0387.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0387th.jpg" width="233" height="156" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">SPIRÆA CANESCENS (syn. flagelliformis).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spiræas.</span>&mdash;Another beautiful and interesting class
for effect either in summer or winter, when sufficiently
large plantations are made and properly
treated. The whole of these should be planted at
a distance of 2 feet apart, on deeply-trenched and
well-manured ground. The North-West American
<i>Spiræa Douglasi</i>, though one of the most common,
is unsurpassed for its distinct and beautiful wood
during autumn and winter, but the only way to see
it at its best is to cut it clean to the ground every
year during the last week in March. It will then
produce young strong growths from 4 to 5 feet
in height, each of which will furnish fine heads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
deep-pink flowers during summer, and its beautiful,
warm-looking, nut-brown wood in winter is among
the most richly toned of all the barks which are
used to produce effect, and yet when grown in the
ordinary way, and partially pruned down, as we in
nearly all cases see it, it produces miserable flowers,
and the wood is uninteresting. About every third or
fourth year after pruning give a surface dressing of
half-decayed manure and loam in equal proportions.
The prunings should be tied up and saved for staking
purposes; they are of the utmost value for all kinds
of slender-growing plants. <i>S. callosa</i> also makes a
fine bed, and is very effective during late summer;
its large heads of deep-pink flowers render it most
conspicuous; they are produced when the others are
past their best. It should be cut to the ground
every third year. <i>S. prunifolia flore-pleno</i> is a very
beautiful form, flowers freely in March and April,
and its foliage assumes lovely tints in the autumn.
It is of very graceful habit, and well suited for banks
or overhanging rocks. It should be moderately
pruned each year, and when it attains to a leggy
appearance cut hard back. <i>S. canescens</i> (syn. <i>flagelliformis</i>)
makes splendid beds owing to the pretty
arrangement of the foliage. This should be pruned
to the ground annually.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symphoricarpus racemosus</span> (the Common Snowberry)
is generally regarded as an almost worthless
plant, but when in a sunny open position on well-trenched
land and cut close to the ground each year,
large beds are most attractive in autumn and winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
as by such treatment the growths will become thickly
studded with pure white fruits. <i>S. orbiculatus variegatus</i>
is a very pretty, somewhat slow-growing golden-leaved
shrub, and should be planted in an open
position. It has a tendency to revert back to the
green form. Shoots of the type should be kept cut
away. This should be slightly pruned in spring, and
when leggy cut to the ground.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Evergreens</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberis</span> (syn. <span class="smcap">Mahonia</span>) <span class="smcap">aquifolium</span>, or Holly-leaved
Barberry, is too well known to need much
description. It is one of the most useful and
accommodating of shrubs, and will succeed in almost
any soil, and either in the open or under the shade
of trees is quite at home. For clothing banks few
things can equal it, and when thus used should be
pruned close to the ground after flowering. It
should be planted when in a small state 18 inches
apart, choosing the beginning of April for the purpose.
It should be cut to the ground each year
after planting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Box.</span>&mdash;The entire Box family is excellent for
grouping when the soil is suitable, but it is waste of
time to attempt planting it in large quantities unless
the position and soil agree with it. A light surface,
with a chalky subsoil, is what it enjoys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laurels.</span>&mdash;The two best Laurels are <i>Prunus
Laurocerasus caucasica</i>, the hardiest of the whole
family, and <i>rotundifolia</i>. The former may be
severely pruned and is excellent for clothing large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
bare places, mounds, or banks; <i>rotundifolia</i> is a
splendid variety with larger foliage, but not so hardy.
The ground in which these Laurels are to be planted
should be trenched or bastard trenched, and small
plants be planted 3 feet apart all ways. To keep
them in condition, prune hard down during the growing
season twice, if not three times, when they will
remain in good health for many years. <i>Prunus lusitanica</i>
(Portugal Laurel) is happy in heavy soils, and
its beautiful dark-green leaves are very telling. This
should also be planted in trenched ground at a
distance of 5 feet apart, and pruned once only
during the year. So treated, splendid beds are
formed when suitable positions are chosen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotoneaster buxifolia</span> or <span class="smcap">Wheeleri</span>, is a fine
strong-growing evergreen for almost any soil. It
is well adapted for making beds, covering large
boulders or the old roots of trees, and for covering
ugly iron fencing. <i>C. buxifolia</i> is a graceful
and pleasing plant when covered with its bright
berries, and allowed to assume its natural habit.
Plant 3 feet apart, merely thinning out the growths
occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotoneaster microphylla.</span>&mdash;A very charming
shrub, and when planted on a raised position, or
on overhanging rocks, tree roots, and such like, forms
beautiful masses, especially when thickly studded
with its crimson berries. It sometimes becomes
badly infested with brown scale, but this is easily
got rid of by applying a strong solution of soft soap
and water with a syringe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ilex aquifolium</span> (the Common Holly).&mdash;The
Holly is one of the very finest of our evergreens
for bold planting. Fortunately, it is one of the few
evergreens that will succeed and grow luxuriantly
under the drip of trees, where many other things
fail. Large breadths of Holly in good health are
a pleasure to look at at all seasons of the year,
particularly when well laden with bright-scarlet
berries. The Holly is seen at its best on light, well-drained
soils, that of a stiff clayey nature (especially
so when water-logged) being the most unfavourable
to its growth. Fortunately, it will adapt itself to
any mode of pruning, but unquestionably the best
way to treat it is to plant in large bold clumps,
allowing it to grow away at its own sweet will.
Many of the more uncommon varieties, both green
and variegated, make highly attractive groups and
beds, and where expense is of little object should
most certainly be planted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhododendrons.</span>&mdash;Of course, one must possess
a suitable soil to plant the more beautiful varieties in
any quantity; nevertheless, the common <i>R. ponticum</i>
and hybrid seedlings, of which there are now fortunately
a great variety, will succeed in nearly
all soils free from lime. The ground should be
thoroughly broken up during autumn, and the
planting done 4 feet apart in the spring. The seed-vessels
should be picked off after flowering, and
the plants are much benefited by an occasional top-dressing
of road grit and leaf soil. Even here on
a cold London clay, where the ground has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
well drained and treated as above, they succeed
very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruscus aculeatus</span> (Butcher's Broom), a native
of this country, is invaluable for planting in shady,
sheltered spots. It appears to enjoy the drip from
other trees, and is very accommodating as to soil
and position, but likes to remain undisturbed.
<i>Ruscus racemosus</i>, which is a native of Portugal, and
commonly called the Alexandrian Laurel, is unquestionably
the best of the Ruscus family, and its
growth very much resembles that of the Bamboo.
It is rarer than the commoner kinds, but it deserves
extended cultivation, being worth a good position
in any part of the gardens or grounds. It berries
freely in some seasons. It lasts remarkably well,
and is very handsome in a cut state. It enjoys a
deep rich loam, but will not fail to give a good
account of itself on any soil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juniperus Sabina tamariscifolia</span> is a beautiful
shrub for the fringe of a plantation, it is of robust
growth, and the best of the Junipers for this planting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taxus baccata aurea</span> <i>variegata</i> and <i>elegantissima</i>
(the Golden Yew) are most effective evergreen shrubs.
They should be planted in open sunny positions.
Without doubt <i>elegantissima</i> has no rival, being the
most useful and telling golden evergreen shrub we
have. It is of somewhat slow growth, consequently
should be planted fairly thick. Like the Common
Green Yew, it succeeds in almost any kind of soil,
but it colours best on a deep yellow loam in a
thoroughly exposed position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ulex europæus</span> (Common Gorse or Whin).&mdash;This
common British plant needs little description
here. When seen in its wild state, where it is
thoroughly naturalised, it presents a most charming
sight. Half-wild patches of land may easily be
made suitable for it at little expense. During winter
the land should either be ploughed or dug, and the
seed sown during April, either in drills or broadcast,
and the seedlings thinned to a fair distance
apart during the following spring. When once
thoroughly established, little trouble will be experienced
in keeping the ground well stocked.
Occasionally, when the old plants become leggy,
they should be cut close to the ground immediately
after flowering, and in a short time these will break
away freely from the bottom. <i>Ulex europæus flore-pleno</i>
is an invaluable plant for all kinds of ornamental
planting, and is struck from cuttings, which are
potted up. In this way the plants are distributed;
nevertheless, it is a most important plant to have.
The flower is a much brighter yellow than the
common form, is produced more freely, and lasts
a considerable time in beauty. It is very suitable
for either making beds or forming large patches of
colour behind rocks and among the fissures of the
rock garden. It should be planted about 3 feet
apart, in fairly good ground, and about every fifth
year pruned down close to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Viburnum Tinus</span> (<i>Laurustinus</i>).&mdash;A beautiful evergreen
flowering shrub, and generally well known,
but unfortunately it is not sufficiently hardy to plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
in many parts of the country, especially in exposed
positions. It will grow and flower profusely in
very shallow and, indeed, in almost any soil. It
makes a handsome bed, and should be planted 4 feet
apart.</p>

<p>The Hon. Vicary Gibbs has taken keen interest
in the tree and shrub planting in the gardens of
Aldenham House.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">THE USE OF HARDY CLIMBING SHRUBS<a name="FNanchor_2_18" id="FNanchor_2_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_18" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h3>


<p>The best and best known of our good hardy climbing
shrubs are by no means neglected, but yet they are
not nearly as much or as well used as they might be.
Such a fine thing as the easily-grown <i>Clematis montana</i>
will not only cover house and garden walls with its
sheets of lovely bloom, but it is willing to grow in
wilder ways among trees and shrubs, where its natural
way of making graceful garlands and hanging ropes
of bloom shows its truest and best uses much better
than when it is trained straight along the joints of
walls or tied in more stiffly and closely. Even if
there are only a few stiff bushes such as Gorse or low
Thorns to support and guide it, it gladly covers them
just as does the Traveller's Joy (<i>Clematis Vitalba</i>) of
our chalkland hedges. This climber, though a native
plant and very common in calcareous soils, is worthy
of any garden. <i>C. V. rosea</i> is a very fine variety.
<i>Clematis Flammula</i> is another of the family that should
be more often treated in a free way, and grown partly
trained through the branches of a Yew or an Ilex.
The less-known <i>Clematis orientalis</i>, with yellow flowers
and feathery seeds, and the fine October-blooming
<i>C. paniculata</i>, make up five members of one family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>apart from the large-flowered Clematises, that all
lend themselves willingly to this class of pictorial
treatment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 235px;"><a id="image0068" name="image0068" href="images/illus0395.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">CLEMATIS MONTANA OVER ROUGH WALL.</p>

<p>One of the most important of our climbing shrubs,
the <i>Wistaria</i>, makes grand growth in all the south of
England. This also can be used to excellent effect
trained into some rather thinly-furnished tree such
as an old Acacia. Its grey snake-like stems and
masses of bloom high up in the supporting tree
are shown to excellent effect. This is also a fine
plant for a pergola. A few plants growing free and
rambling full length would, after the first few years,
when they are getting old, cover a pergola from end
to end. The piers or posts could also be covered
with the same, for though the nature of the plant is
to ramble, yet if kept to one stem and closely pruned
it readily adapts itself to pillar form, and bears a
wonderful quantity of bloom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;"><a id="image0069" name="image0069" href="images/illus0396.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">CLEMATIS MONTANA OVER ARCHWAY.</p>

<p>Among the Grape Vines there is a great variety of
ways of use other than the stiff wall training they
generally receive. If they are wanted for fruit they
must be pruned, but most outdoor Vines are grown
for the beauty of their foliage. Here is another first-class
pergola plant, making dense leafy shade, and
growing in a way that is delightfully pictorial.
Nothing looks better rambling over old buildings.
Now that so many once prosperous farms are farms
no longer, and that their dwelling-houses are being
converted to the use of another class of occupier,
the rough out-buildings, turned into stabling, and
adapted for garden sheds, often abut upon the new-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>made
pleasure-garden. This is the place where the
Vines may be so well planted. If the main stem
only is trained or guided it is well to leave the
long branches to shift for themselves, for they will
ramble and dispose themselves in so pictorial a way
that the whole garden is bettered by their rioting
grandeur of leaf mass.</p>

<p><i>Aristolochia Sipho</i>, with its twining stems and handsome
leaves, will, like the Vine and the Virginian
Creeper, answer to all these uses of jungle-like
growth among trees and shrubs and free climbing
in hedge, over pergola or rough building.</p>

<p>The employment of the climbing and rambling
Roses is also now understood for all such uses, and
the illustration shows the value of the Dutch Honeysuckle
for this purpose.</p>

<p>A rough hedge containing perhaps only a few
Thorns and Hollies and stub Oaks, and a filling of
Wild Brambles, may be made glorious with the
free hardy climbers just guided into the bushes
and then left to ramble as they will.</p>

<p>In the growth of the rarer and most distinct and
beautiful of climbing shrubs one must in the main
be guided by the natural surroundings of soil and
shelter or by climatic conditions. In the cold midland
and northern districts of England we have
seen common Laurels and many Roses killed to the
ground during severe winters.</p>

<p>In Hampshire, Devon, and Cornwall, and in many
other isolated and sheltered nooks near the sea in
England south of the Thames, many so-called cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
greenhouse plants often grow and thrive luxuriantly
in the open air. This is also true of many localities
in the south and west of Ireland, such as Fota,
Cork, Bantry, and Tralee, where New Zealand,
Japanese, Californian, and many Chilian shrubs are
quite happy in the open air. Nearly all visitors to
Glengarriff notice the luxuriance of the Fuchsias,
which, not being cut down there every winter by
severe frosts, assume more or less of a tree-like
aspect, and are literally one mass of brilliant coral-red
flowers during summer and autumn. But it
is even more wonderful to see there growing up
the front of the hotels and elsewhere such plants
as <i>Maurandya</i>, <i>Lophospermum</i>, <i>Mikania</i>, and Cape
Pelargoniums year after year. But, apart from
mild climates, aspect has an enormous effect on
many climbing shrubs, and especially on light dry
soils. <i>Lapageria</i>, for example, prefers a northern exposure,
and the same is true of <i>Berberidopsis corallina</i>,
and the remarkable <i>Mutisia decurrens</i>. Many climbers
and trailers, again, are hardy on north or north-western
walls that are ruined by bright sunshine
after frost, which is often experienced on south and
especially south-western exposures. Even when
climbers like <i>Wistaria</i>, <i>Jasminum nudiflorum</i>, <i>Ceanothus</i>,
<i>Pyrus</i> and many others are perfectly hardy on sunny
walls it is often a great advantage to train a few
branches over the top of the wall to the shady side,
as in these cases there is a week or ten days or more
difference in the time of blooming, and so an agreeable
succession is obtained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>In planting both walls and pergolas there is
danger in planting too thickly, and in planting too
hurriedly or without sufficient preparation. We all
must perforce often do the best we can rather than
the best we know. Large-growing, permanent
shrubs, such as <i>Pyrus japonica</i>, <i>Wistaria</i>, and <i>Magnolias</i>,
which may remain in the same spot for
twenty years or more, often fail through starvation,
and in any case never attain their full luxuriance
and beauty if cramped and stunted during the first
few years after planting. Again, it must be remembered
that both wall and pergola creepers
often suffer from dryness during the summer and
autumn months, and provision should be made for
necessary mulching and watering.</p>

<p>There is one important point that must be attended
to in the planting of anything of which the
general hardiness is not fully assured, and that is,
never plant late in autumn. The golden rule with
all half-hardy things is to plant well in April or
May, after all danger from severe frost, &amp;c., is over,
so as to allow the plants a long summer and autumn
season of root and top-growth before the stress and
strain of winter weather come upon them. In this
way many plants will succeed perfectly in establishing
themselves that would at once die off if planted
out in October or November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abelia.</span>&mdash;<i>A. floribunda</i> is a Mexican plant. Mr.
Burbidge writes in the <i>Garden</i>, April 14, 1900, p.
272: "I have seen it very handsome in flower on a
low wall at Mount Usher, county Wicklow. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
pendent flowers in axillary clusters are of a rich
purple red, and remind one of some Fuchsias."
<i>A. chinensis</i>, a Chinese plant, is very pretty, as
also is <i>A. triflora</i> from North India.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abutilon.</span>&mdash;Several of the Abutilons are sufficiently
hardy to thrive on walls or in borders near
to heated plant-houses. Mr. Burbidge writes in
the <i>Garden</i>: "I have seen <i>A. striatum</i>, <i>A. vexillarium</i>,
and <i>A. vitifolium</i> grow and bloom for years outside.
The last-named forms a spreading bush 10 to 13
feet high in South, West, and Eastern Ireland. It
has leaves somewhat resembling those of the Grape
Vine, and clusters of pale-lilac, mauve, or lavender-tinted
flowers that remind one of those of <i>Meconopsis
Wallichi</i> in shape, size, and colour. <i>A. vitifolium</i>
comes from Chili, and enjoys shelter and ample
root moisture, being apt to suffer from drought
near walls, otherwise it grows well thereon." <i>Abutilon
vexillarium</i>, when afforded the protection of
a south wall, blooms for eight months out of the
twelve, bearing on slender, curving shoots its handsome,
bell-shaped flowers with their crimson sepals,
yellow petals, and protruding dark-brown stamens
well into the month of December should no severe
frost occur. Florists' varieties of the Abutilon, such
as Boule de Neige, also do well on sheltered walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adlumia cirrhosa.</span>&mdash;This grows quickly, and the
fern-like leaves, covering almost the twining stems,
possess much beauty; the flowers are white. A
biennial, but sows itself freely. North America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Akebia quinata.</span>&mdash;A most distinct Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
creeper with five-lobed leaves and twining stems;
although generally grown in a greenhouse, where
it flowers in January or February, it is quite hardy
in mild sea-shore places, and bears its mon&oelig;cious
flowers in April or May. The rich wine-purple
flowers are borne in axillary grape-like clusters, and
their translucent petals are very beautiful as seen
between the eye and the light. It likes a rich, deep,
loamy soil, and is increased by suckers or layers.
Although introduced to our gardens from Chusan
in 1845, it has never become very abundant, but it
deserves a place for its distinctive character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aloysia citriodora</span> (Sweet Verbena).&mdash;Another
popular name for the <i>Aloysia</i> is Lemon plant; it is a
fragrant pale-green leaved bush, not very hardy, and
therefore best placed when against a sunny wall.
Except in quite the south of England and Ireland, it
is generally wise to cover over the stems with a straw
mat and heap ashes over the roots. It is often seen
as a large bush against the sea. We have seen it
thus on the Carnarvon coast. Chili.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ampelopsis.</span>&mdash;Now included with the Vines (<i>Vitis</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apios tuberosa.</span>&mdash;This has pea-shaped violet-scented
flowers. It is sometimes pretty rambling
over a shrub. North America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aristolochia Sipho</span> (Dutchman's Pipe).&mdash;Frequently
planted against a wall; its leaves are very
large and handsome, and the dull-coloured flowers,
owing to their shape, have given rise to the popular
name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atragene alpina.</span>&mdash;A hardy wall climber, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
known under the name of <i>Clematis alpina</i>. It enjoys
a lime soil. A native of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Azara.</span>&mdash;The best known of these is <i>A. microphylla</i>;
it is not one of the hardiest of shrubs, but in many
gardens, especially where sheltered and by the sea,
it covers much space with dense glossy leaves; the
flowers are white, small, and give place to orange-coloured
berries in autumn. It is quite a shrubby
wall plant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benthamia fragifera.</span>&mdash;Now known as <i>Cornus
capitata</i>, but in gardens its old name will long be
retained. In Devon, Cornwall, and in Wicklow,
Cork, and Kerry, and elsewhere in Ireland, this fine
shrub flowers and fruits luxuriantly as a bush on
the border or lawn, but in less favoured places it
needs the warmth and shelter of a wall. It is a
native of Nepaul, and is readily increased from
home-grown seeds, and the plant, like all its allies,
is a rapid grower in any deep, rich, loamy soil.
Quite small bushes of this plant and the common
<i>Arbutus Unedo</i> are often very handsome as seen laden
with fruit in South and Western Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Berberidopsis corallina.</span>&mdash;Mr. Burbidge writes
in the <i>Garden</i>: "The finest specimen of this beautiful
and distinct evergreen climber I ever saw was
on the stable wall at Lakelands, Cork, when that
noble place was in the hands of the late Mr. William
Crawford, a great lover of garden vegetation. It is
a native of the Chilian Andes, introduced in 1862.
It likes a deep peaty soil or loam and leaf-mould on
a moist bottom, and, like the <i>Lapageria</i> and its dwarf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
cousin <i>Philesia</i>, it enjoys a northern or shaded aspect,
rarely thriving for long together in full sunshine.
Its flowers resemble those of the Berberis, but are
much larger, have pendent stalks, and are of the
brightest coral-red or blood colour. It grows and
flowers here in a shaded corner under an ivy-topped
wall."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bignonia capreolata.</span>&mdash;This is the hardiest of the
Bignonias. It needs a warm wall, and there is much
beauty in the warm, reddish-orange, trumpet-shaped
flowers, which are in clusters from April to August.
It grows to a considerable height. North America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Billardiera longiflora.</span>&mdash;This is the Apple
Berry of Tasmania, and is of elegant twining habit,
its greenish-yellow flowers, which are not very showy,
being succeeded by handsome blue berries that are
very ornamental, and are similar in shape and size to
Fuchsia fruits. The plant is closely related to the
<i>Pittosporums</i> of New Zealand, and grows 2 or 3 feet
in height. There are two or three other kinds, but
none prettier than <i>B. longiflora</i>. It grows best in
moist peat and sandstone, at the foot of a half-shaded
wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calystegia.</span>&mdash;Also known as Convolvulus. <i>C.
pubescens fl. pl.</i>, the double Bindweed, is more useful
for rough stumps than walls, but may be included;
the flowers are double, of rosy colouring, and large,
and appear during the summer and into the autumn.
It is best in warm, well-drained soil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camellia.</span>&mdash;Mr. Scrase-Dickins writes in the
<i>Garden</i>, March 30, 1901, p. 227, as follows about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
these little-understood hardy shrubs: "The best
Camellias for planting out of doors in the open air
are those which bloom late and start late into
growth, such, for instance, as <i>Chandleri elegans</i> or
<i>Anemonæflora</i>; the varieties with broad roundish
leaves appear to grow in more robust fashion than
those having narrow pointed ones with a serrated
edge, though the latter will make sometimes very
compact bushes. It is possible that the sorts with
dark-red flowers are hardier than those with pink.
The old double white seems to stand the cold well
enough, but it hides its flowers rather too much
among the foliage to make any effective display of
them, though in this way they are often secured
from frost or bad weather and made serviceable
for cutting. To train against a trellis or wall
<i>Doncklaarii</i> is very good, and next to <i>reticulata</i> one of
the most beautiful when well grown, blooming so
freely.</p>

<p>"Camellias appear to grow in almost any aspect,
but are naturally sun lovers; and though preferring
peat, they will do in most other soils, provided that
there is no lime present. The points of the young
roots are very sensitive to drought, so should be
protected until well established, by light mulching
or a surrounding growth, from the risk of being
withered up by a fierce sun striking the ground in
which they are starting. Unlike many other shrubs,
they seem to have the advantage of being exempt
from the destructive attention of rabbits; perhaps
when snow is on the ground they might be barked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
but I do not remember to have noticed it. Apart
from the question of varieties, it may be well to draw
attention to the fact that only strong healthy plants
should be turned out, for sickly specimens from a
conservatory or greenhouse are very slow indeed to
make a start, and will remain sometimes for an
astonishing number of years in almost the same
pitiable state."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceanothus.</span>&mdash;Beautiful wall shrubs. They cannot
be regarded as quite hardy, but <i>C. azureus</i> in a garden
near London has mounted almost to the chimney
stacks; a surface of foliage, and in the appointed
season pale-blue flower clusters. The soil is light
and the aspect due south; and in cold, sunless
places the Ceanothuses, it is well to remember,
utterly fail. A warm soil and sunny place suit the
shrubs well. Gloire de Versailles, Lucie Simon, and
<i>pallidus</i> are amongst the best of the others. Of other
species, <i>C. veitchianus</i>, deep blue, is very beautiful; and
<i>C. dentatus</i> and <i>C. papillosus</i> are also noteworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chimonanthus fragrans</span> (Winter-sweet).&mdash;The
variety <i>grandiflorus</i> has larger flowers and of a
clearer shade of citron yellow than those of the type,
and though the plant is bare of leaf the blossoms
make a brave show, and may be descried against a
well-toned brick wall from some little distance. It
is just as well to bear in mind that this is one of the
shrubs which bloom on the young wood, and any
pruning or cutting out of useless branches that may
be necessary should be done in early spring when
the flowers are over, for if it be delayed there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
no flowers next year. It may be raised from seed,
but seedlings vary greatly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Choisya ternata</span> (Mexican Orange Flower).&mdash;Very
vigorous, shrubby, glossy, green-leaved plant; rather
tender, but quite happy in northern gardens if not
very exposed. Its clusters of flowers are very sweet
and white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clematis</span> (see p. <a href="#Page_303">303</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotoneaster</span> (see p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diervilla.</span>&mdash;May be grown against fences and
even walls, but are better against the former. I saw a
fence covered with the crimson-flowered Eva Rathke
in a London garden, and flowered abundantly every
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eccremocarpus scaber.</span>&mdash;Climber for wall, arch,
or pergola, with reddish flowers. Protect the roots
by coating the soil above them with ashes or some
protective material.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwardsia (Sophora) tetraptera.</span>&mdash;This is
called the New Zealand Laburnum. A tree in its
own country, but a shrubby wall plant here. <i>Grandiflora</i>
is the best variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Escallonia</span> (see p. <a href="#Page_385">385</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fuchsia.</span>&mdash;The hardy Fuchsias are almost unknown,
though amongst the most beautiful of hardy
shrubs. My favourite is <i>F. Riccartoni</i>, but this often
makes a good hedge. Very charming also are
<i>F. coccinea</i>, <i>F. corymbiflora</i>, <i>F. globosa</i>, <i>F. macrostemma</i>,
<i>F. microphylla</i>, <i>F. splendens</i>, and <i>F. thymifolia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hablitzia tamnoides.</span>&mdash;Better, perhaps, for arch,
pergola, or tree stump than a wall, but in some cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
it may be placed there. It is a vigorous climber,
with misty masses of greenish flowers in summer and
autumn. Not often seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hedera</span> (Ivy).&mdash;The Common Ivy when growing in
an exposed position will often acquire a rich bronzy
hue during winter, but in this respect individual
plants vary a good deal, the smaller-leaved forms
being as a rule the richest in colour.</p>

<p>The most marked in this respect, and one that
from its neat, prettily-lobed leaves is well suited for
use in making up button-holes, sprays, &amp;c., is the
variety <i>atropurpurea</i>, whose distinctive character is far
more marked in winter than in summer. <i>Hedera
Helix minima</i> must not be confounded with <i>H. H.
conglomerata</i>, though at a certain stage of growth
there is some similarity. A three-year-old specimen
differs from the freer <i>conglomerata</i> form in that it
grows more flat both as regards the twigs and the
leaves on the twigs. It has more shining foliage of
a deeper and more sombre green, with pleasing
clouded tints, and further, as the name would suggest,
it is a smaller plant in all its parts. It is a beautiful
creeper for positions on the rock garden, and is one
of the best surface plants, as through it bulbs may
spear their growth and flowers without injury. <i>H. H.
pedata</i> and <i>H. H. gracilis</i>, both charming varieties of
the small-leaved Ivies, should be in every collection.</p>

<p>The uses to which Ivy may be put are innumerable,
and with the many beautiful varieties that are
now to be obtained their sphere of usefulness has
considerably extended. One of the most picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
methods of growing Ivy is to allow it to clamber
over tree stumps placed here and there in suitable
parts of the garden. Ivy banks also are very charming,
and for carpeting the bare ground beneath the
spreading branches of large trees nothing could be
more suitable. For the latter purpose the shoots
should be pegged down and kept in position so that
they may take root. Suitable varieties for this purpose
are <i>H. dentata</i>, <i>H. rægneriana</i>, <i>rhombea</i>, <i>obovata</i>,
<i>himalaica</i>, <i>pedata</i>, <i>palmata</i>, <i>lobata</i>, &amp;c.; but the best of
all is an Ivy called Emerald green.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">CAMELLIA, LEAF AND FRUIT (outdoors Cheshire).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indigofera gerardiana.</span>&mdash;During the late summer
and early autumn this leguminiferous shrub is
one of the most attractive of those that are then in
flower. Its finely divided pinnate leaves are of a
rich deep green, and almost fern-like in grace and
luxuriance. It is, indeed, worth growing for their
sake alone. About the end of June it commences to
flower, produces its flower-spikes in the leaf-axils,
and continues to do so until the middle of September.
The flowers are pea-shaped, and borne on spikes
4 to 5 inches long. The colour is a bright rosy
purple. The species is a native of the Himalaya, and
its stems do not survive winters of even moderate
severity. The root-stock is, however, perfectly
hardy, and it sends up a thicket of young growths
every spring 2 to 4 feet long, which flower the same
summer. It is not suited for growing in large
masses by itself, because it starts rather slowly, and
the season is advanced before the space the plants
occupy becomes furnished. But it is very suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
for the herbaceous border, or, still better, as an
undergrowth beneath groups of taller, thinly-planted
shrubs. It is happy also against a wall. Also
known as <i>I. floribunda</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jasminum.</span>&mdash;The White Jasmine (<i>J. officinale</i>) is too
well known to describe. It is one of the best of
the cheaper wall climbers. <i>Affine</i> is the best variety;
it has larger flowers. <i>J. humile</i> (<i>revolutum</i>), although
an Indian species, will succeed against a wall; it has
yellow flowers and is evergreen. <i>J. fruticans</i>, another
bushy species, may also be grown; its flowers are
yellow, and succeeded by an abundance of round
black berries which are very distinct and pleasing in
winter. Of course, the beautiful, fragrant, yellow-flowered
<i>J. nudiflorum</i> will not be omitted. The new
<i>J. primulinum</i> has large yellow flowers in spring.
Wants a wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kerria japonica.</span>&mdash;Sometimes grown against a
wall, but an excellent bush for grouping, except in
very cold and exposed gardens. The flowers are
yellow and produced abundantly. It should be
more grown. The double variety, <i>K. j. flore-pleno</i>,
is frequently seen against cottage walls, and making
a cloud of yellow from the double rosette-like flowers
in early summer. The major form of this is the best.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">DUTCH HONEYSUCKLE ON WALL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lonicera</span> (Honeysuckle).&mdash;This is too well known
to describe. The Honeysuckle of the hedgerow is
as familiar as the Poppy of the cornfield. The
common native Honeysuckle is <i>Lonicera Periclymenum</i>,
the best variety of which is <i>serotina</i>, or late Dutch; it
flowers into the autumn, and is of redder colouring.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
<i>Belgica</i> is the Dutch Honeysuckle and is of strong
growth. <i>L. Caprifolium</i> is not a true native, but
has become naturalised. <i>Major</i> is a distinct variety.
Then there are the evergreen Trumpet Honeysuckles
(<i>L. sempervirens</i> and varieties, <i>minor</i> being the best
known; the flowers are scarlet and yellow). <i>Plantierensis</i>
is a good hybrid with larger flowers. The
Trumpet Honeysuckles are not so robust and free as
the late Dutch, for example. The well-known variegated
Japan Honeysuckle, <i>L. japonica aureo-reticulata</i>,
should not be planted much; its small, green, yellow-netted
leaves are pretty, but one quickly tires of their
colouring. <i>L. etrusca</i>, orange yellow, and <i>L. flava</i>,
which must have a warm place, may also be mentioned.
Certain species are quite bushy in growth.
<i>L. tomentella</i> has small pink flowers in July. <i>L.
fragrantissima</i> blooms in winter and is a delightful
wall Honeysuckle; its small white flowers are very
fragrant. <i>L. Standishii</i> is also sweet scented. A plant
or two of either kind near the windows is very
pleasant on sunny winter days. The Honeysuckles
are charming, and should be in every garden&mdash;at
least one or other of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnolia.</span>&mdash;<i>M. grandiflora</i> (evergreen) is generally
grown against a wall. The large, glossy, green leaves
and big, creamy, fragrant flowers are very handsome.
<i>M. conspicua</i> (deciduous) I have also seen very beautiful
against a wall, a mass of white in late spring. The
flowers in this position are less likely to get damaged
by frost and rain. Its varieties may be used in the
same way, but the type is the best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Olearia</span> (see p. <a href="#Page_405">405</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Passiflora cærulea.</span>&mdash;Few climbing plants are
more fascinating than the blue Passion Flower. It
is, with its bluish flowers and orange, egg-shaped
fruit, most happy against a warm wall, and is not the
hardiest of climbers. The white variety, Constance
Elliot, should be grown also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Piptanthus nepalensis</span> (Nepaul Laburnum).&mdash;This
is a shrubby wall plant, and not a very important
one. Its yellow flowers remind one of those
of the Laburnum, and are borne in clusters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 178px;"><a id="image0072" name="image0072" href="images/illus0417.jpg">

<p class="caption">POLYGONUM BALDSCHUANICUM OVER FIR.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polygonum baldschuanicum.</span>&mdash;A beautiful
shrubby climber, with clouds of white, pink-tinted
flowers in summer and autumn. An illustration
shows it clambering into a Fir tree near the rock
garden at Kew. I have seen many poor forms in
gardens, seedlings, and therefore to keep the true
type, it must be increased by cuttings. If frost cuts
the stems down in winter, new growths spring up in
the following year. Its graceful flower masses are
useful in the house. <i>P. molle</i> is not unlike it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prunus triloba</span> is an excellent wall shrub (see
illustration).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Punica</span> (Pomegranate).&mdash;Both single and double.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pyrus.</span>&mdash;The Pyruses are described elsewhere in
this book. <i>P. (Cydonia) japonica</i> and its many beautiful
varieties, and <i>P. Maulei</i> are, however, more frequently
grown against walls than any other members of the
same family. <i>Prunus triloba</i> is an excellent wall shrub.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raphiolepis ovata.</span>&mdash;A very handsome plant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosa</span> (Rose) (see p. <a href="#Page_342">342</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rubus</span> (see p. <a href="#Page_450">450</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smilax.</span>&mdash;This group is not common in gardens,
but is interesting. They are a change from the
repetition of a few common things. <i>S. rotundifolia</i>
is a very handsome large-leaved Smilax with shiny
foliage, now and then met with as <i>S. laurifolia</i> or <i>S.
latifolia</i>, from which, however, according to Mr. R.
Irwin Lynch, of Cambridge, it is distinct. All the
kinds of hardy Smilax form handsome leafy creepers
for walls, but in our climate they rarely produce
the rich clusters of red berries that often render them
so attractive abroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Solanum.</span>&mdash;<i>S. jasminoides</i> is the most popular
flowering climber of the south-west, producing its
white bloom-clusters for many months in succession.
It is classed as deciduous in botanical dictionaries,
but is rarely bare of leaves, except after severe frosts
in the early months of the year. <i>S. crispum</i> and
<i>S. Wendlandi</i> will also succeed in mild counties; the
latter has very large bluish flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stauntonia latifolia</span> (syn. <i>Holb&oelig;llia latifolia</i>).&mdash;This
plant bears clusters of small greenish-white,
highly-fragrant flowers in March, and often perfects
seed-pods in the autumn. It is a rapid grower, and
its leathery leaves are rarely affected by frost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stuartia pseudo-Camellia.</span>&mdash;A rare and very
beautiful flowering shrub now seldom seen in even
the best of gardens. It is a native of Japan, the
flowers being ivory white and perfectly cup-shaped,
somewhat like a single White Camellia. <i>S. pentagyna</i>
comes from North America, as also <i>S. virginica</i>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the first-named is the finest and is worth a good deal
of trouble to grow well. Planted in loam and peat
and sand at the foot of a sunny and sheltered wall,
the flowering shoots may be preserved intact during
the winter. Perfect drainage is absolutely essential
for the first-named.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tricuspidaria hexapetala.</span>&mdash;A very distinct and
beautiful evergreen shrub, perhaps better known as
<i>Crinodendron Hookeri</i>. It is a native of Chili, and grows
5 or 6 feet high, its stiff branches set with dark, shiny
ovate leaves. The flowers are nearly globular, very
fleshy, and rich crimson-red or cherry colour. In
both co. Wicklow, at Mount Usher, and at Salerno,
co. Dublin, this rare shrub is very luxuriant and
beautiful. It grows well in deep, rich, moist loam
or in peaty soils, and propagates readily by layers
laid down under stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Viburnum.</span>&mdash;Some of the Viburnums are handsome
against walls, such as <i>V. macrocephalum</i> and the
Chinese <i>V. plicatum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vitis</span> (Vine).&mdash;The Vines are the most graceful
and beautiful of all climbers, and many of them are
of glorious colour in autumn. The Virginian Creepers
(<i>Ampelopsis</i>) are now grouped with the Vines. Of the
American Vines, <i>Vitis æstivalis</i>, <i>V. californica</i>, beautiful
autumn colour; <i>V. cordifolia</i>, the Northern Fox Grape
(<i>V. Labrusca</i>), Southern Fox Grape (<i>V. vulpina</i>). The
Virginian Creeper (<i>V. quinquefolia</i>) is, as is generally
known, very showy in autumn. Of the Asiatic Vines,
<i>V. Coignetiæ</i> is the most famous. It has very large
leaves, which turn to a glowing crimson in autumn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
It is a noble climber. <i>V. heterophylla humulifolia</i> has
beautiful fruit, each berry about the size of a pea and
turquoise blue; it likes a warm, sunny wall. <i>V. (Ampelopsis)
Veitchii</i> is too well known to describe. <i>V.
Romaneti</i> and <i>V. vinifera</i>, the Common Grape Vine,
also deserve notice. Of the last-mentioned there
are many beautiful varieties, such as <i>Purpurea</i>,
Miller's Burgundy, Teinturier, with claret-coloured
foliage, and the Parsley-leaved Vine. <i>V. Thunbergi</i>
has very fine leaves, which turn crimson in autumn.
The Vines should be seen in greater variety, and
Messrs. Veitch's recent beautiful novelties planted too.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD WISTARIA AT HAMPTON COURT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wistaria.</span>&mdash;Wistaria time is a pleasant season of
the year. A few noble examples may be seen in the
suburbs of London, especially at Kew and Hampton
Court, where the trees must be a great age, while
quite a fine plant is in the Royal Gardens, Kew, also.
What may be achieved with this plant if some attention
to its needs were forthcoming is not clear, for
most of the Wistarias we see from time to time shift
for themselves, and by the position they occupy must
have large numbers of their roots in dusty, dry soil.
In former days it was always the custom to plant this
fine climber at the base of the dwelling-house wall,
but now, with a fuller knowledge of its robust growth,
its widely-extending branches, and equally its wide-rooting
capacity, other positions may with advantage
be secured for it. One example may be seen at Kew,
where a fine plant covers a huge cage-like structure.
Another good way would be to plant it to run over
pergolas, and with Clematis to succeed the Wistaria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the effect would be distinctly good. <i>W. sinensis</i>, the
mauve-flowered species, is the one usually planted.
The variety <i>alba</i> is less robust, and does not flower so
freely; it wants a warm place. The double variety is
very beautiful when in perfection, but our experience
is that it never flowers freely, and the raceme is often
poor. <i>W. multijuga</i> has very long racemes, and is
the Wistaria which gives so much beauty to the gardens
in Japan. It is always a pleasure in Wistaria
time to visit the Royal Gardens, Kew, and see the
exquisitely coloured trails of flowers on this species;
these trails measure between 2 and 3 feet in length.
Rosea is a rose-coloured variety.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">FLOWERING AND OTHER HEDGES</h3>


<p>Of the more or less known 3000 species and varieties
of trees and shrubs hardy in this country, only a
small proportion are suitable for making good hedges.
Every garden of any size has a hedge or two of
untidy look through inattention at the proper time.
A hedge must be kept in proper order, not a difficult
business when clipping is done annually, when to
do so depending upon the plants used.</p>

<p>Hedges may be of two kinds&mdash;the neat trimmed
hedge, which serves as an outside line to a garden,
and also as a screen or wind-break to small or tender
plants growing near it; and the straggling rough
hedge, varying from 10 to 20 feet in width, more
properly a wide bank made up of all sorts of plants,
rambling Roses, ornamental Vines, and other things
which usually serve to brighten some spot where
colour is desirable, or to shut out an undesirable
view. The best plants comprise both evergreens and
deciduous, but only one thing should be used, as
mixed hedges are rarely a success, and of mingled
evergreen and deciduous plants are generally quite
a failure. It is right to mention, however, that if a
mixed hedge is planted the best results are from
White Thorn, Holly, and Common Beech. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
best evergreen plants in their order of merit are
Holly, Yew, Arbor-vitæ (<i>Thuya occidentalis</i>), <i>Thuya
gigantea</i> or <i>Lobbi</i>, Common Box, <i>Cupressus lawsoniana</i>,
<i>C. nootkatensis</i> (<i>Thujopsis borealis</i>), Privet (<i>Ligustrum</i>),
Common Laurel, Portugal Laurel Pyramid
Laurel (<i>Prunus lusitanica myrtifolia</i>), <i>Berberis Darwinii</i>,
and <i>Osmanthus ilicifolius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holly.</span>&mdash;The Common Holly makes one of the
best evergreen hedges. Its growth, though somewhat
slow, is regular, and it does not mind the
shears, but it is costly to use to any extent. It does
not move readily, so that for the first year or two
there will probably be a few gaps to fill up, but when
the hedge is once established it is there practically
for ever, and with proper attention will never become
rough or unsightly. Before planting the site should
be marked out, and the ground trenched 3 feet wide
and deep, breaking the subsoil with a fork, and
working some well-decayed manure about half-way
down. This will tend to draw the roots down, and
keep them from running out on either side to the
injury of neighbouring plants. Plants should be
obtained in the early autumn, as soon as it is safe
to move them, and planted at once before the ground
gets cool. If this be done they will make fresh roots
and get established before winter. Some prefer to
move Hollies in May, but much depends on whether
artificial watering can be done. If it can, May is
quite as good a time as September or October; if
not, then choose the autumn.</p>

<p>The size of the plants used depends upon taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and the depth of the pocket, but good plants, 1&frac12;
to 2 feet high, with a leading shoot or two on each,
placed from 12 to 16 inches apart, can be recommended,
as they move readily at that size, and are
not so costly as larger plants. Holly hedges should
be clipped in late August or early September, when
they will make a short growth before winter, and
keep in good condition without further attention
until the following autumn. The height of the hedge
is entirely a matter for the owner to decide, one 30
or 40 feet high, properly feathered to the ground,
being quite possible, as we know from some already
in existence. When grown to this height, however,
the top should be cut to a point to throw off snow.
The flatness of the hedge can be broken by allowing
a few leading shoots, 20 or 30 feet apart, to run
up, budding them in August with some of the
variegated varieties. Gold Queen, Waterer's Gold,
Silver Queen, and <i>Argentea variegata</i> are good sorts
to use for this.</p>

<p>When a Holly hedge has been neglected for some
years cut it back to the old wood in March or April,
and fork in a liberal dressing of manure around it.
It may not make much growth the first year, but
will practically re-establish itself the second.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yew.</span>&mdash;The Common Yew is hard to kill, and easy
to prune into various shapes, as topiary work suggests.
Yew is generally used for the inside of a garden, such
as terraces and hedges near the house. It should be
treated in the same way as the Holly, with the important
exception of being clipped in May, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Yew makes most of its growth in the early part of
the year. In buying Yews, choose rather stunted-looking
plants in preference to those of fresher look
and freer growth. The former have been moved
within the last year or two, the latter have stood for
three or four, and become coarse rooted, suffering,
therefore, after removal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arbor-vitæ.</span>&mdash;For a hedge this and <i>Thuya gigantea</i>
can be placed together. The common Arbor-Vitæ
is sometimes not liked because it gets brown in
winter, but this colouring is not so pronounced in
<i>Thuya gigantea</i>. In preparing the ground little or no
manure need be trenched in, but a dressing of spent
manure may be added with advantage. The soil
should be as good as possible, but not too heavy.
They may be clipped at any season, and for the first
two or three years twice annually will not be too
often. It is wise to cut off from six inches to one
foot of the leaders every year, otherwise the plants
attain a great height without breadth. If a hedge
of these conifers is allowed to become rough and
ragged, it is almost impossible to restore it, as it
will not, except in special cases, break from the
older wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Box.</span>&mdash;The dwarf edging so largely used for
borders and paths needs no description, but the
Common Box is not so largely used because it gets
yellow, the result of sheer starvation, the Box being
a gross feeder, requiring plenty of feeding at all
times. It should have a dressing of manure annually,
or at least biennially, to keep it in good health and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
colour. It should be clipped in the spring, April or
May being the best months, and a top-dressing about
the same time will be very beneficial to it. Box
is a good shrub for an inside hedge, but should never
become overgrown, as, in addition to the hard cutting
necessary to bring it into shape, it is a terrible plant to
cut, even the small wood being very hard and tough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lawson Cypress.</span>&mdash;<i>Cupressus lawsoniana</i> and <i>C.
nootkatensis</i> (<i>Thujopis borealis</i>) can be treated together,
as, in addition to their natural relationship, both
require the same treatment as a hedge. Neither
makes a good flat-topped hedge of the ordinary kind,
as the growth is distinctly pyramidal, and unless
kept to a point is apt to get injured by snow.
They should be cut to a point, and a hedge 12 to
20 feet high of this shape is very handsome and
effective in a garden, as well as forming a first-rate
screen. They can be trimmed at any time preferably
in the spring or early summer, care being taken not
to cut the base too hard, and the leading shoots top
annually. In planting no manure need be used,
provided the ground is good, and it is not required
later on unless the hedge shows signs of starvation,
when a good top dressing may be given with
advantage. Plants 2 or 3 feet in height, placed
about 18 inches apart, are a good size to use, as they
move readily and are not expensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Privet.</span>&mdash;The oval-leaved Privet (<i>Ligustrum ovalifolium</i>)
is a native of Japan, and makes a fairly good
hedge about 5 or 6 feet high. It grows readily,
and moves without any trouble at almost any time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
It can be bought cheaply. The ground should
be well treated in the first place; afterwards it will
require little attention in the way of feeding. It can
be clipped at almost any time, but for the first year
or two should be cut hard back before growth begins
in the spring. Neglect of this leads to a hedge that
is leafy at the top but bare at the bottom. In this
note the use of Privet is not wholly condemned, but
it must be understood its use is not recommended.
There is no doubt whatever that for town gardens
the Privet is of the greatest service, enduring smoke
and fog with impunity. It is vigorous, and soon
becomes established in the most dreary gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laurels.</span>&mdash;Any of the various forms of the Common
and Portugal Laurels with the types are suitable for
what may be called second-rate hedges, the best
being the Pyramid Portugal, which is a smaller-leaved
and more upright-growing kind than any of
the others. With the exception of the last-named,
all the Laurels make hedges rather wide for their
height, and all require much attention to keep them
in proper shape. All should be clipped in June,
after the first growth is made; they will then make
another short growth, which will keep the hedge in
good condition until the following year. The Pyramid
Portugal has leaves about half the size of those of
the type and quickly makes a hedge. It is rather
more expensive than the commoner Laurels, but it
moves well, and does not become bare at the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Osmanthus ilicifolius.</span>&mdash;This plant has not
been much used for hedges, but it makes a very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
one if carefully looked after during the first year or
two. It somewhat resembles the Common Holly,
and requires much the same treatment. It is not
very expensive to buy, and the hedge should be kept
to a height of 3 or 4 feet.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">Deciduous Hedges</h3>

<p>Many deciduous plants can be used for hedges,
but a good selection comprises Beech, Hornbeam,
Quick, Myrobalan Plum, and Sweetbriar. The first
two require practically the same treatment, the most
important part of which is to procure good two or
three years old transplanted plants, and to treat them
liberally at first. Beyond an annual trimming they
will not require any further attention, except to tie
or peg down a branch or two where gaps may
occur. A well known gardener, writing in the
<i>Garden</i>, says: "We often find the Holly and the
Yew largely used in gardens as hedges, but they are
not quite so good under all conditions as the Beech
or Hornbeam. The Beech is one of our many hardy
trees both for screens and hedges. The Copper
Beech is seldom used for this purpose, but this is a
mistake. We have a fence of the Copper Beech,
dividing the kitchen garden from the pleasure
grounds, 138 yards long, 18 feet high, and from
4 feet to 5 feet through. It forms a perfect wall
on either side, and in spring is one of the most
interesting features of the place. It would be useless
planting the Copper Beech on a wet or heavy
soil&mdash;a light soil suits it best. The hedge is now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
perfect health, and all that is necessary is an annual
clipping about the end of August, before the wood
gets hard."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;"><a id="image0076" name="image0076" href="images/illus0433.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0433th.jpg" width="233" height="148" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">GREAT BEECH HEDGE AT MICKLEOUR, N.B.</p>

<p>Quick and the Myrobalan Plum should be planted
in double rows to form a hedge, and be cut back
hard at the time of planting to form a bottom to the
hedge, which would otherwise become leggy and
bare at the base. If they should happen to get into
this state most of the growth should be cut away,
and the main branches tied or pegged down in the
direction of the hedge. In a year or two it will be
practically as good as ever.</p>

<p>For a dividing line between the flower and kitchen
gardens, or for some spot where too much formality
is not required, the Common Sweetbriar makes an
excellent hedge, although it requires much attention
for the first few years. If planted without support,
such as a wooden railing, it should be kept tied or
pegged down almost to the ground for the first two
or three years, using practically every growth that
is made by the plants. By this means a good
foundation is laid for the hedge, which will, when
made, merely require an annual trimming. We
plant Sweetbriars everywhere. Its leaves in the early
morning, or after a warm summer rain, saturate the
air with their fragrance.</p>


<h3 class="gap2">Hedges of Flowering Shrubs</h3>

<p>It often happens that some kind of hedge is wanted
in a garden, either as a screen to hide vegetable
ground, or as a wind-break, or some kind of partition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
When this is the case, it is a good plan to plant
hardy flowering shrubs about 4 feet apart, and so
to train and trim them that they grow into a compact
hedge, and yet have enough lateral play to allow
them to flower. Two years ago we privately advised
some friends who were planting new gardens where
such dividing hedges were wanted, and the hedges
are already coming into use and beauty.</p>

<p>Such a hedge is not only ornamental, but it yields
endless material for cutting. It should be allowed
to grow quite 4 feet thick, and is best formed with
a backbone of stiff woody shrubs, such as Guelder
Roses, <i>Ribes</i>, and Lilac, while between the stiffer
shrubs might be some that are weaker, such as <i>Kerria</i>,
<i>Rhodotypus</i>, and <i>Leycesteria</i>. Plants of rank rambling
growth, such as free Roses and double-flowered
Brambles, <i>Aristolochia</i>, <i>Wistaria</i>, Virginia Creeper, and
the rambling Honeysuckles, are not in place in such
a hedge; they are more suitable for rough hedge
banks, walls, or for arbour and pergola; the flower
hedge wants true shrubs. The bush Honeysuckles,
such as <i>Lonicera fragrantissima</i> and <i>L. tatarica</i>, are
just right, or any woody, twiggy bushes of moderate
growth, or such as are amenable to pruning and
thinning, such as <i>Deutzia</i> and Snowberry, shrubs that
so often get overgrown in a shrubbery. In the
hedge these would do well, as they could easily be
watched and thinned; also many true shrubs that
flower all the better for reasonable pruning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;"><a id="image0077" name="image0077" href="images/illus0434.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">HEDGE OF MAIDEN'S BLUSH ROSE (6 feet to 7 feet high).</p>

<p>Any one would be surprised to see what a quantity
of useful flowers such a hedge would yield, while, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
there is another of foliage for winter use, it will be
invaluable to the indoor decorator. We have just
planted a hedge for this use, all of golden variegated
or yellow-leaved shrubs, those chosen being the
Scotch Gold Holly, Golden Euonymus, Golden
Privet, yellow variegated Box, and Golden Tree
Ivy, all shrubs of the utmost value for winter
cuttings. Though they are barely 2 feet high as
yet, the slightly varied golden hedge is already
a pleasant, cheering sight in the quickly-shortening
November days.</p>

<p>Other flower hedges are also delightful possessions.
Hedges of China Rose, of Lavender, of Sweetbriar,
of old garden Roses, or of climbing or rambling Roses
trained down, of Honeysuckles, of Jasmine; some
of these are occasionally seen, but of a good selection
of true shrubs hedges are rarely if ever made.</p>

<p>Any of the shrubs recommended for the mixed
flowering hedge could, of course, be used alone; and
excellent it would be to have a hedge of Guelder
Rose or flowering Currant or Japan Quince, and
how much more interesting than the usual hedge
of Quick or Privet or Holly. Both sides of the
flower hedge should be easily accessible, not necessarily
by a hard path, but by a space just wide
enough to go along comfortably. An additional
advantage well worth considering would be that,
supposing the direction of the hedge to be east and
west, the south side would flower in advance of the
north, and so prolong the supply of bloom.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">PLEACHED OR GREEN ALLEYS</h3>


<p>In the old days the pleached alley was as familiar
in English gardens as the pergola of the present
age. Both are interesting, and both provide grateful
shadowed walks in the heat of summer. The
trees most generally used in the fashioning of
pleached alleys were the Hornbeam and Lime,
both native of this country, but green alleys have
been made of Yew, of <i>Cotoneaster buxifolia</i>, of
Holly, and other evergreens. There are flowering
Cherries of weeping habit that would suit well for
such treatment, and several other small trees of
pendulous growth, such as Laburnum, Weeping
Ash, and the large-leaved Weeping Elm. There
is an important green alley at West Dean, near
Chichester, of Laburnum only.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 232px;"><a id="image0078" name="image0078" href="images/illus0439.jpg">
<img src="images/illus0439th.jpg" width="232" height="159" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">A NUT WALK.</p>

<p>The green alley differs from the pergola in that
the pergola has solid and permanent supports, its
original purpose, in addition to the giving of shade,
being to support vines. The green alley, being
made of stiffer and more woody growths, only
needs a temporary framework to which to train
the trees till they have filled the space and formed
the shape. Hornbeam was the tree most used in
former ages, and for a simple green alley nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
is better. Beech is also good. Several other of
the smaller trees of weeping growth should be
more used for this and the allied uses of training
for arbours and other shelter-places in the
garden.</p>

<p>The common Plane is much used on the continent
for green shelters; the trees are pollarded
at about eight feet high, and the vigorous young
growths trained down horizontally to a slight
framework.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to make a green alley
with two or perhaps three kinds of plants whose
leaf form was of the same structure. For instance,
a groundwork of Weeping Ash could soon be
trained into shape, and Wistaria would be best to
grow all over and through it. The more stiff and
woody Ash would supply the eventual solid framework,
as by the time the Wistaria was making
strong growth (for it is very slow to make a beginning)
the whole would be well in shape, and
might dispense with the framing of "carpenters'
work" that is necessary for its first shaping. It
would be best to plant the Ash zigzag across the
path so that the main of the head of each tree
might be trained across the path and down to
the ground on the opposite side, when it would
occupy the space between the two opposite trees.</p>

<p>It is important to further maintain the distinction
between green alley and pergola by using in
the green alley only things of a permanent and
woody character; no Roses or Clematis, or any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
other plants of which portions are apt to die or
wear out. These are proper to the pergola, whose
permanent substructure makes it easier to cut
away and renew those of its coverings, whether
structural or growing, that are liable to partial
decay.</p>

<p>A great many delightful things may be done
with these green alleys and green shelters. Much
interest is already aroused in the pergola, and
when thinking of this it is well to consider these
other ways of adding to the comfort and charm of
our gardens. One thing, however, should be carefully
considered. It should be remembered that
where a path is made more important by passing
under trained green growths it should have some
definite reason for being so accentuated, certainly at
one and desirably at both ends. It often occurs
that in laying out ground the owner wishes to
have a pergola, as it were, in the air, and when
there is nothing to justify its presence. It should
not be put at haphazard over any part of the
garden walk. If of any length, it should distinctly
lead from somewhere to somewhere of importance
in the garden design, and should, at least at one
end, finish in some distinct full-stop, such as a
well-designed summer-house or tea-house.</p>

<p>Another important matter is that a pergola or
green alley, in the usual sense, should never wind
or go uphill. It is not intended by this that
shading coverings cannot be used in such places,
but that they would want especial design, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
altogether a matter of doubt if these could not be
much better treated in other ways.</p>

<p>The circumstances of different gardens are so
infinitely various that it is impossible to lay down
hard rules; only general rules can be given and
exceptional circumstances dealt with by exceptional
treatment.</p>

<p>Green alleys require some attention. In winter
the oldest of the wood must be cut out to make
room for the young growth, and when this is
lengthening vigorously it must be carefully laid in.</p>

<p>If the alley has an iron framework, which is necessary
when such strong growing things as Wistaria are
used, this may be clothed during the first few years,
until the Wistaria is growing strongly, with annual
climbers such as <i>Cobæa scandens</i>, <i>lophospermum</i>, <i>Mina
lobata</i>, and even varieties of the large-flowered
Clematis, which must be removed when the Wistaria
covers the alley.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">OLD APPLE WALK (Helmingham Hall).</p>

<p>Very charming alleys are sometimes formed of
fruit trees&mdash;Pear, Apple, Cherry, and Plum making
delightful spring pictures, and almost as much so
when in fruit in autumn. Where fruit and flower
are desired every shoot must be exposed to sun and
air. When densely shaded by other growths the
wood does not ripen, and therefore flowers badly, if
at all.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">THE GARDEN ORCHARD</h3>


<p>One's enjoyment of the garden would be greatly
increased if the orchard, which is so often thrust
away into a remote corner, were brought into direct
communication with it. How easily the trimmer
lawn spaces might lead through groups of flowering
shrubs to the rather rougher grassy orchard. How
naturally the garden Roses and masses of free-growing
Cluster Roses would lead to their near relations,
the Pears and Apples and other fruiting trees of the
great Rose order.</p>

<p>There is no need to make a definite break between
the two; it is all the better not to know where the
garden ends and the orchard begins. Towards the
edge of the mown lawn there may already be trees
of the Red Siberian Crab and the handsome Crab
John Downie, and the pretty little Fairy Apple;
while the nearer orchard trees may well be wreathed
with some of the free Cluster Roses, such as Bennett's
Seedling or Dundee Rambler.</p>

Blackberry and a thicket of Crabs or Filberts, and

alley. There is no need to be always moving the
garden orchard. One wide, easy, grassy way might
well be kept closely shorn, but much of the middle
and side spaces had better not be cut until hay-time,
for many would be the bulbs planted under the turf,
great drifts of Daffodils and Spanish Scillas, and
Fritillaries for the larger effects, and Colchicums
and Saffron Crocus for the later months. If the
grass were mown again in September, just before
the Colchicums appear, it would allow of easy access
to the fruit trees in the time of their harvest, and
in those interesting weeks immediately before the
Apples ripen.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD MEDLAR TREE ON EDGE OF GARDEN ORCHARD.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the best use of many
fruit-bearing trees is not restricted to the kitchen
garden only, for many of them are beautiful things
in the most dressed ground. Few small trees are
more graceful in habit than the old English Quince
that bears the smooth, roundish fruits. It is not
only a pleasant object in leaf and flower in early
summer, and in autumn glory of golden fruit, but
even when bare of leaves in winter a fully matured
tree is strikingly beautiful, and in boggy ground
where no other tree would thrive it is just at its
happiest and is most fruitful. Then many Apples
are extremely ornamental, and there is a whole range
of Crabs; Siberian, Chinese, and home-raised hybrids
that are delightful things both in flower and in fruit.
<i>Pyrus Maulei</i>, vieing in beauty of bloom with its near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
neighbours, the Japanese Quinces, quite outdoes them
in glory and bounty of fruit, which in October is
one of the most brilliant things in the garden. There
are no better garden ornaments for foliage than Figs
and Vines, and though the needful pruning of a Vine
for fruit takes off somewhat of its pictorial value,
which depends in some measure on the wide-flung,
luscious summer growth and groping tendril, yet in
any shape the Grape Vine is a thing of beauty.
Some of its garden kinds also show how, in distinct
departures in colour and shape of leaf, it is always
beautiful; for the Parsley-leaved Vine, with its dainty
and deeply-cut foliage, is a suitable accompaniment
to the most refined architecture; while the red-purple
leaf of the Claret Vine and its close clusters of blue
fruit are richly ornamental in the autumn garden.
A Medlar tree, with its large white bloom and handsome
leaves, is desirable, and several of the Services
are ornamental small trees. Every one knows the
lovely pink bloom of the Almond in April, but few
may have tried something that is not an experiment
but a certainty&mdash;namely, the successful culture of
the hardier Peaches, near relatives to the Almond,
as standards in the south of England. A Peach of
American origin, the Early Alexander, bears full or
fair crops every year. The only danger is from leaf
blister from sudden cold in May, but if its position is
sheltered, or if it can be afforded the protection of a
net, it will suffer but little, and perfectly ripened
peaches, red all round, may be had at the end of
July. The beauty of Cherry blossom is so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
known that it needs no extolling; and any great high
wall looks the better at all seasons for a well-trained
old Pear.</p>

<p>A free planting of the cut-leaved Bramble is
pleasant to see on the outskirts of the garden, and
is beautiful in leaf, in flower, and in fruit.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">THE WORTHY USE OF ROSES</h3>


<p>For a full consideration of the Rose as a garden
flower, one must look to such a work as "Roses
for English Gardens," but as the Rose is a flowering
shrub it cannot be omitted from the present volume.</p>

<p>In these days of horticultural prosperity and rapid
progress, when there would appear to be one or
more specialists devoting themselves to every worthy
flower, we need scarcely say that the Rose has not
been forgotten. Indeed, within the memory of many
who have watched its culture for the last forty years,
the rapid advance is nothing less than astonishing.
Our own veteran growers and some of the foreign
firms seem to have vied with each other in producing
new forms in the Hybrid Perpetuals and in the
Teas, but it has been almost within the last decade
that growers have not only deepened the interest
in the cultivation of the Rose, but have immensely
widened it by striking out in new directions.</p>

<p>It is now many years since the late Henry Bennett
raised such lovely hybrids as Grace Darling and
Mrs. John Laing, but the parents of these were still
among the well-known H.P.'s and Teas and Chinas.
But of late years hybridists have taken in hand some
of the handsomer of the species, and by working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
them with well-established favourites have produced
whole new ranges of fine Roses. Of these the most
prominent have been products of <i>R. multiflora</i>, <i>rugosa</i>,
<i>rubiginosa</i>, and <i>wichuraiana</i>. The striking success of
many of these later hybrids is encouraging in the
highest degree, and the field for future work is so
immense that the imagination can hardly grasp the
extent of the prospect that these earlier successes
seem to open out.</p>

<p>There are so many ways in which Roses may be
beautiful. Even in the varied form and habit possessed
by the types some special kind of beauty
is shown and some special garden utility is foreshadowed.
And then we think of the future possibilities
of the Rose garden! Already&mdash;we say it
with deliberation and a feeling of honest conviction&mdash;the
Rose garden has never been developed
to anything like its utmost possible beauty. The
material already to hand even twenty years ago has
never been worthily used.</p>

<p>The Rose garden to be beautiful must be designed
and planted and tended, not with money and labour
and cultural skill only, but with brains and with
love, and with all those best qualities of critical
appreciation&mdash;the specially-cultured knowledge of
what is beautiful, and why it is beautiful&mdash;besides
the indispensable ability of the practical cultivator.</p>

<p>There are in some places acres of Rose gardens,
many of them only costly expositions of how a Rose
garden had best not be made. The beautiful Rose
garden, that shall be the living presentment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
poet's dream, and shall satisfy the artist's eye, and
rejoice the gardener's heart, and give the restful
happiness and kindle the reverent wonderment of
delight, in such ways as should be the fulfilment of
its best purpose, has yet to be made.</p>

<p>It matters not whether it is in the quite free
garden where Roses shall be in natural groups and
great flowery masses and arching fountains, and
where those of rambling growth on its outskirts
shall clamber into half-distant surrounding trees and
bushes, or whether it is in the garden of ordered
formality that befits a palatial building; there are
the Roses for all these places, and for all these and
many other uses. Indeed, for reducing the hard
lines of the most formal gardens and for showing
them at their best, for such enjoyment as they may
give by the humanising of their rigid lines and the
softening of their original intention as a display of
pomp and state and the least sympathetic kind of
greatness, the beneficent quality of age and accompanying
over-growth may be best shown by the
wreathing and clambering cluster Roses, whose
graceful growth and tender bloom are displayed all
the better for their association with the hard lines
and rough textures of masonry surfaces.</p>


<h3 class="gap2 smcap">Some Beautiful Wild Roses</h3>

<p>No family of hardy shrubs is more bewildering
in the multiplicity and intricacy of its nomenclature
than Rosa. Although there are many species
now accepted by botanists, yet the pseudo-specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
names may be counted by hundreds. Fortunately
for those interested in their cultivation, a good many
of these names refer to plants with very unimportant
distinctions (many of them, indeed, are minor forms
of our native Dog Rose), and the best of the wild
species are mostly grown under the names applied
to them in the following notes.</p>

<p>Their cultivation is simple. They are like the
Hybrid Perpetuals in their love for a rich loamy
soil&mdash;one inclining to a clayey rather than to a
sandy nature. Loving abundant sunlight, they are
not happy in shady spots. The commonest mistake
in their cultivation is in pruning. The notion that
they have to be cut back like Hybrid Perpetuals and
such-like Roses has often resulted in the loss of a
season's flowers, besides destroying for the time the
peculiar beauty of habit that many species possess.
The shoots, often long, sucker-like growths that push
from the base in summer, supply the flowers of the
following year, and until they have flowered should
not be touched with a knife. Whatever pruning
is necessary&mdash;and it is, as a rule, a mere matter of
thinning out of old worn-out stems&mdash;is to give the
young growths more air and freedom. No shortening
back is needed. It may always be remembered
that some of the most beautiful specimens of Wild
Roses in existence, especially those of rambling
growth, have never been pruned at all. The chief
thing is always to retain the free, unfettered grace
natural to the plants. Pruning will help to do this,
but it must be pruning of the proper kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>In the wilder parts of the garden the common
Dog Rose (<i>R. canina</i>) and its numerous varieties are
worth a place; they flower well, and are always
beautiful in fruit. The same may be said of the
Sweet Briar (<i>R. rubiginosa</i>), the fragrance of whose
young growths is always a delight, whether in garden
or hedgerow. <i>R. hibernica</i>, a British Rose, thought
to be a hybrid between the Scotch Rose and <i>R.
canina</i>, comes in the same category. It flowers
earlier than the Dog Rose.</p>

<p>For the wild garden also there are several
other Roses that may be mentioned, such as <i>cinnamomea</i>,
with rosy-red flowers and crimson fruit;
<i>nutkana</i>, <i>acicularis</i>, <i>pisocarpa</i>, and <i>californica</i>. Only
those are mentioned that from their greater
beauty and distinctness deserve a more detailed
notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. alba.</span>&mdash;Although found wild in several parts
of Europe, this, the "Common White Rose" of Linnæus,
is supposed to be a hybrid between <i>R. gallica</i>
and the Dog Rose. It is always found in places
which lead to the belief that it is not truly indigenous,
but an escape from cultivated grounds. The
typical plant has white flowers that are considerably
larger than those of the Dog Rose, and the petals
have more substance. There are now numerous
double-flowered varieties in gardens, some beautifully
tinged with rose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. Alberti.</span>&mdash;A native of Turkestan, where it was
discovered by M. Albert Regel not many years ago.
This is one of the rarest species of Rosa in cultiva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>tion.
The flowers are bright yellow, the leaves small
and much divided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. alpina.</span>&mdash;This is the species from which the
Boursault Roses have been derived. It is a native
of the Alps and Pyrenees. The stems are 4 to 5
feet high, and have few or no spines except when
young. The flowers are rosy red; the fruits red,
often pear-shaped, and covered with bristles, which,
when rubbed, have a turpentine-like odour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. arvensis</span> (or <span class="smcap">R. repens</span>).&mdash;From this species
the Ayrshire Roses have been obtained. It is naturally
a trailing or climbing plant, having long thin
shoots and white flowers. When trained over tree
stumps or rough stakes and ultimately allowed to
grow at will, it forms tangled masses which are very
pretty. But the double forms&mdash;even the common
variety, <i>flore-pleno</i>&mdash;are to be preferred, being especially
useful in semi-wild spots. The type is wild in
England, and frequently to be seen in hedges and
thickets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. carolina.</span>&mdash;For certain positions this is a useful
Rose. It has erect stems and forms dense thickets,
spreading rapidly by means of the numerous underground
rhizomes it sends out in all directions. The
flowers are purplish-rose. A later-flowering variety
known as <i>nuttalliana</i> is a stronger grower and has
larger flowers. This will flower up to September.
<i>R. lucida</i> and <i>R. nitida</i> are, like <i>R. carolina</i>, natives of
North America, and are of similar habit, but they are
dwarfer and the leaves are more glossy. All these
are apt to become crowded with old stems, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
besides an occasional thinning out, are much improved
by dividing up every three or four years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. ferruginea</span> (<span class="smcap">R. rubrifolia</span>).&mdash;This species,
which comes from the Pyrenees and Alps, is remarkable
for the reddish-purple colour of its leaves
and young shoots. Groups of half-a-dozen or more
plants give a striking colour effect. The flowers are
similar to the Dog Rose, but red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. lævigata</span> (<span class="smcap">R. sinica</span>).&mdash;Except in the south
and south-west or in similarly favoured localities, this
is not really hardy, but where it thrives it is a singularly
beautiful Rose, perhaps unsurpassed among
single Roses in the size of its pure white flowers. It
is known as the Cherokee Rose, and is naturalised in
some of the Southern United States. A lovely hybrid
between it and <i>R. indica</i> has been raised and named
Anemone. Its flowers are soft rose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. lutea</span> (Austrian Briar)&mdash;Of all the Wild Yellow
Roses this is the most beautiful. The yellow-flowered
species do not, as a rule, thrive so well as the others
in gardens&mdash;one has only to mention such species as
<i>berberifolia</i>, <i>sulphurea</i>, <i>xanthina</i> (or <i>Ecæ</i>) to recall that.
But <i>R. lutea</i>, in strong loam with plenty of lime added,
generally thrives well. The copper-coloured varieties
are more difficult to deal with in suburban districts.
The flowers of the typical <i>R. lutea</i> are of the brightest
rich yellow. When in good health it produces each
year long arching shoots, wreathed from end to end
with blossom. This species comes from the Orient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. microphylla</span>&mdash;This interesting species is
closely allied to <i>R. rugosa</i>, and is a native of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
China. It has a sturdy bushy habit, few spines, and
the curious habit of peeling its bark. Its foliage is
very handsome, the leaflets being small and numerous.
The flowers are rose coloured and very fragrant.
The shrub is interesting for its fine fruits, which are
of large size, very spiny, and of a yellowish colour
when ripe. Although some other species surpass
this in showiness, it is one of the most distinct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. moschata</span> (Musk Rose).&mdash;When seen at its
best, few of the rambling species are more beautiful
than this. It is not, however, so hardy as some,
especially when young, in which state it makes
long, succulent shoots during summer and autumn,
which are apt to be killed back in winter. Old
plants do not suffer in the same way, or not so
severely. Its flowers are borne in great clusters, and
are notable for their pure whiteness and conspicuous
bunches of bright-yellow stamens. The best plants
often of this species are in shrubberies, where, no
doubt, the other shrubs afford it some protection.
It is a native of the Orient and India. The name
"Musk Rose" refers to a perfume which may occasionally
be detected in its flowers after a shower, but
is never very apparent. <i>Nivea</i> is a beautiful form.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">ROSA MULTIFLORA</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. multiflora.</span>&mdash;This, the Polyantha Rose, the
wild type of the group so named and the progenitor
of many graceful Roses, is a native of Japan and
China. It is a shrub 8 feet or more high, forming
a dense thicket of arching branches. Its flowers
individually are small, but they come in large dense
clusters and so abundantly as to transform the shrub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
into a mass of white. They are very fragrant. This
is an admirable plant for putting at the top of a wall
or steep bank which it is desirable to drape with
vegetation. The Polyantha group of Roses can
always be distinguished by the stipules at the base
of the leaf-stalk being fringed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. ochroleuca.</span>&mdash;In stature, foliage, and mode of
growth this is like the Scotch Rose, but its flowers
are of as bright and rich a yellow as those of the
Austrian Yellow (<i>R. lutea</i>). Where <i>R. lutea</i> does not
grow well, this will be an excellent substitute. A
native of Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. pomifera</span> (Apple Rose).&mdash;This is, perhaps, the
most striking of Roses in regard to its fruit. The
hips are 1 to 1&frac12; inches long, apple or pear-shaped,
of a fine bright red, and covered with bristles. It is
a species that requires generous conditions at the root
to be seen at its best. <i>R. mollis</i> and <i>R. tomentosa</i> belong
to the same group, and have also fine red fruits, but
they are much smaller than those of <i>R. pomifera</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. rugosa</span> (Japanese Rose).&mdash;No plant has come
to the front more rapidly in recent years than this
Rose. It was introduced from Japan in 1845, but
appears to have been neglected. It is one of the
very hardiest of Roses, as well as one of the sturdiest
and most robust. The leaves are very handsome,
the leaflets being of a rich green and wrinkled. The
flowers in the wild type are rosy crimson, but there
is also a white variety, and seedlings give quite a
variety of shades. It hybridises freely with other
species and garden varieties, and has in this way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
enriched our gardens with many good hybrids,
Mme. Georges Bruant and the Coubert Double
White among them. The fruits of <i>R. rugosa</i> are
orange-shaped, scarlet red, and of large size&mdash;altogether
very ornamental.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 234px;"><a id="image0083" name="image0083" href="images/illus0458.jpg">

<p class="caption">HYBRID ROSE UNA, A SHRUBBY GROUP ON GRASS.</p>

<p class="caption">(Bed is 70 feet in circumference and contains 15 plants.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. sericea.</span>&mdash;For some reason this Rose has never
obtained the recognition it deserves. Perhaps its comparative
rarity may account for this. It is the earliest
of all Roses to flower out of doors, its first blossoms
opening as a rule towards the latter end of May; the
flowers are creamy white. In the cooler days of May
and early June it lasts longer in bloom than many of
the later flowering species do. It has one very distinctive
character, in the petals being nearly always
four (instead of the usual five) to each flower. Sometimes
the bark of the young shoots is a bright red.
A native of North India.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. setigera.</span>&mdash;Of the North American Roses none
has proved more useful in this country than the Prairie
Rose. A rambler in habit, it is valuable for its vigorous
growth and late flowering. The flowers are
large, deep rose, and appear in July and August.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. spinosissima</span> (<span class="smcap">R. pimpinellifolia</span>).&mdash;The Scotch
Rose is one of the earliest species to bloom; it is also
one of the prettiest and most distinct. The stems are
dwarf and covered with bristles, the leaves small, and
the flower white and cup-shaped. There are several
wild varieties of it, the two most noteworthy being
<i>altaica</i> (or <i>grandiflora</i>) and <i>hispida</i>. Both these grow
6 feet or more high, and the flowers of both are larger
than the typical Scotch Rose. Those of <i>altaica</i> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
creamy white; those of <i>hispida</i> a lovely cream yellow.
The garden varieties of this Rose are numerous&mdash;some
double, some single, and varying in colour from
yellow to white and from pink to purple. The type
is found wild in several parts of Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. webbiana.</span>&mdash;Coming from some of the highest
elevations on the Himalaya at which shrubby vegetation
exists, this species is the hardiest of the Indian
Roses. It has a thin, graceful habit, and its spiny
stems are blue white when young. This year it has
been very pretty in the unusual profusion of its bluish-tinted
flowers, each of which are about 2 inches
across. The leaves are of a blue green, and are
similar in size and division to those of the Scotch
Roses. But it is quite distinct from them or any
others, for which reason it is worth the notice of
lovers of these wild types.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R. wichuraiana.</span>&mdash;It is not many years since this
Japanese Rose was first introduced, but it is now
fairly well known. It is a perfectly prostrate plant,
and is remarkable for the shiny, varnished appearance
of the leaves. It is one of the latest species to come
into bloom. The flowers are pure white, and appear
during July and August in clusters resting on the
carpet of glossy foliage. It makes an excellent covering
for sunny banks where the soil is good. Old tree
stumps are also pretty when covered with this Rose.
It has already been hybridised, and among its progeny
are Pink Roamer, Manda's Triumph, South Orange
Perfection, and Jersey Beauty. There is a very distinct
cross between it and <i>R. rugosa</i> at Kew.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<h3 class="gap2">PLANTING AND STAKING TREES</h3>


<p>A few words of advice upon these important subjects
will be helpful. When planting a tree, prepare the
ground beforehand, so that when the trees arrive
they can be put at once into their proper places
without having to be laid in. If the trees are to be
planted thickly, trench the ground to a depth of at
least 2 feet, keeping the top spit to the top all the
while, merely burying the turf if there is any. If
the soil is poor, enrich it during the trenching. If
possible this trenching should be done the spring
previous to the planting of the trees, and the ground
cropped with Potatoes or Cabbages to keep down
weeds during summer. If the trees are to be planted
wide apart or as isolated specimens, make large holes,
varying in diameter from 6 to 10 feet, these being
trenched 2 or 2&frac12; feet deep and filled in again to
within 1 foot of the surface. The shape of the
hole is a small matter, round or square being
equally good. In some instances, however, especially
when a tree is being moved with a large mass of
soil, a square hole will be found handier than a
round one, on account of the additional room given
by the corners.</p>

<p>The time to plant is of much importance, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
though deciduous trees may be transplanted throughout
winter, October, November, February, and March
are preferable to December or January. October
and November are the two best months, as then the
ground is warm and root action begins before winter
sets in.</p>

<p>If the trees are simply to be transplanted from
one position in the garden to another, the work may
be begun in the case of deciduous trees as soon as
the leaves turn colour and commence to fall. In
lifting, take care not to injure the roots. When
putting the spade into the ground the edge should
be to the tree, not the face. Digging must begin
at a reasonable distance from the tree, and if a ball
of soil is not required, the soil should be forked from
between the roots into a trench which has previously
been made round the stem. If, while lifting, any
of the main roots have suffered, cut the injured parts
away with a sharp knife and tar over the wounds.
When planting, the tree should be stood in the hole,
and a stick laid across the top of the hole near the
tree to ascertain whether the depth is right, sufficient
space for an inch of soil over the uppermost root
being allowed. The centre of the hole should be
filled in slightly higher than the sides, and on the
little mound the tree should be stood, laying the
roots out carefully all round. When filling the
soil in, some fine material should be worked in
among the roots with the hand, and before the hole
is fully filled in give a good watering; this has
the effect of settling the soil well about the roots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
The amount of ramming necessary depends on the
consistency of the soil. After a tree is planted in
early autumn a mulching of rotten manure may be
given, but if the planting is done in spring the
mulching is better left until early summer when the
ground has become warmed.</p>

<p class="caption" style="clear:both;">STAKING TREES.</p>

<p>After planting, staking, where necessary, should
be attended to. It is not necessary to stake every
tree that is planted. When it is sturdy, with a well-balanced
head and set of roots, and the position is
not exposed to rough winds, staking is needless. If,
however, the stem is weak or the roots are mostly
on one side, not spread round the tree, or the
position is very exposed, staking for a time will be
necessary. In the case of young trees little difficulty
will be experienced, as good straight stakes can be
easily got. As a rule, one stake is quite enough for
a tree, and that should be driven in as close as
possible to the trunk without injuring it or the
roots. To the stake the tree should be secured with
wire or stout tar string, using thin cushions of felt,
leather, or old hose-pipe to keep the wire or string
from cutting into the bark. Allow a little room
between the stem and stake for growth. Two or
three ties are usually sufficient, and these should be
examined and loosened once or twice a year until
the stakes can be dispensed with. The habit of
putting in stakes in such a way that they cross the
trunk, and that when the wind blows there is
sufficient play for the stem and the stake to rub
against each other, is a bad one, the chafing often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
causing serious wounds. In exposed situations, or
when there is danger of the tree rocking about and
becoming loose at the collar, put in three stakes in
the form of a triangle, the stem fitting in the space
left between the three stakes at the top, while the
bottoms of the stakes extend some 2 or 3 feet
from the tree. For this purpose wires fastened to
stakes driven in the ground are useful, and neater
than stout stakes. When wires are used, however,
take care to provide a good soft pad between the
tree and the wire. For trees with large heads, or
those not well furnished with roots, this way of
staking will be found very useful. When inserting
stakes they should be properly sharpened for the
sake of straight driving. The staking of trees which
have the lower parts of their trunks straight and
their leaders crooked differs from other staking, as
the stakes should not be driven into the ground, but
tied firmly to the trunk below the bend, the leader
being then drawn to the stake. In all cases, however,
where staking is done the stakes should be removed
as soon as the trees are able to do without them. A
stake is not beautiful. There is always the chance of
the tying material being left a little too long without
examination, and therefore it cuts into the bark.
Ties also harbour insects.</p>

the Horse Chestnut, which
is the tallest of the

generally are of medium
size, and not very
particular about soil or
position. The smaller

<td class="bl br vtop">This is a handsome tree for
the garden, and is
generally about 15 feet
high in Britain. Its chief
charm is in the profusion
and brilliant red colouring
of the flower-spikes. It is
not of quick growth, but
flowers when very young.
It will be found in many
lists under the name of Æ.
rubicunda, the red Horse
Chestnut. Rosea is a good
variety recommended by Mr.
Anthony Waterer as a "tree
for planting in smoky
districts." Another fine
variety, peculiarly bright
in flower colouring, is Æ.
Brioti.</td>

as a rare foreign tree</td>
<td class="bl vtop">White; late May or early June. There is considerable variation, as many of the trees
in parks and gardens have been raised from seed</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">The common Horse Chestnut
is too well known to
describe. It is not a tree
for very exposed places, as
its large leaves offer
considerable resistance to
the wind, and get torn and
unsightly. The double
variety (flore-pleno) is
very distinct, having quite
double flowers. Foliis
aureis variegatis is a
variegated variety, as the
name suggests, with
blotches of yellow on the
leaves; and laciniata has
cut foliage.</td>

feet, with a trunk 3 feet through</td>
<td class="bl vtop">White, with yellow and red blotches at the base of the petals; Summer</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">This distinct and beautiful
tree is perhaps the rarest
of the Horse Chestnuts in
cultivation, and is not so
robust as the common
species. It flowered in
England as long ago as 1858
at Mildenhall in Suffolk,
but has been little heard
of. It is a tree doubtless
for the Cornish and
Devonshire and southern
coast gardens where the
Himalayan Rhododendrons
thrive well. Sir Joseph
Hooker, during his Himalaya
travels fifty years ago,
saw it loaded with its
white racemes, and equal in
beauty to the common Horse
Chestnut of English parks.
Its foliage is quite
distinct from that of the
other species, the leaflets
numbering seven or nine,
and being of a dark glossy
green. In the other Horse
Chestnuts the leaflets are
usually only five to each
leaf, and never more than
seven. The racemes of this
Indian species are about 8
inches long, the flowers
being white, with blotches
of yellow and red at the
base of the petals.</td>

<td class="bl br vtop">This is better known as P. macrostachya, and is a low,
spreading shrub 8 to 10
feet high; the leaves
consist of five to seven
finely serrated leaflets,
covered underneath with a
whitish tomentum. Although
introduced so long ago,
this August flowering shrub
is not common; it is a good
shrub for a small garden,
and is not fastidious about
soil or even situation if
not too shady. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>

<td class="bl bb vtop">Æ. turbinata</td>
<td class="bl bb vtop">Japan (introduced by Messrs. Veitch &amp; Sons)</td>
<td class="bl bb vtop">Yellowish white, not so large as those of the common Horse Chestnut</td>
<td class="bl bb br vtop">As this has not yet
flowered in this country,
as far as we are aware, but
will probably become
popular here, the following
account of it by Professor
Sargent in his "Forest
Flora of Japan" will be
interesting:&mdash;"This,
however, is a noble
tree&mdash;one of the largest
and stateliest of all the
horse chestnuts. In the
forests of the interior
mountain regions of Central
Hondo, at elevations
between 2000 and 3000
feet, horse chestnuts 80 to
100 feet tall, with trunks
3 or 4 feet in diameter,
are not uncommon. These
were, perhaps, the largest
deciduous trees on the main
island growing naturally in
the forest&mdash;that is, which
had not been planted by
men&mdash;and their escape from
destruction was probably
due to their inaccessible
position, and to the fact
that the wood of the horse
chestnut is not
particularly valued by the
Japanese. In habit, and in
the form, venation, and
colouring of the leaves,
the Japanese horse chestnut
resembles the horse
chestnut of our gardens,
the Grecian Æsculus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Hippocastanum, and at first
sight it might easily be
mistaken for that tree, but
the thyrsus of flowers of
the Japanese species, which
is 10 or 12 inches long,
and only 2&frac12; to 3 inches
broad, is more slender; the
flowers are smaller, and
pale yellow, with short,
nearly equal, petals,
ciliate on the margins; and
the fruit is that of the
Pavias, being smooth, and
showing no trace of the
prickles which distinguish
the true horse chestnuts.
The Japanese horse chestnut
reaches Southern Yezo,
finding its most northern
home near Mororan, on the
shores of Volcano Bay, at
the level of the ocean; it
is generally distributed
through the mountainous
parts of the three southern
islands, sometimes
ascending in the south to
an elevation of 4000 or
5000 feet. There seems no
reason why this tree, which
has already produced fruit
in France, should not
flourish in our northern
states, where, as well as
in Europe, it is still
little known. In Northern
Japan the fruits are
exposed for sale in the
shops, although they are
probably used only as
playthings for the
children."</td>

<td class="bl vtop">Catalpa</td>
<td class="bl vtop">Bignoniaceæ</td>
<td class="bl vtop">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">This genus of large
deciduous trees is
represented in both
the eastern and western
hemispheres, and contains
about a dozen species. Only
five of these are at
present in cultivation in
Britain or are known to be
hardy, two being natives of
North America and three of
China. The Catalpas are
some of the most striking
and beautiful of all hardy
trees, both in regard to
foliage and to flower. The
leaves are large and bold
in outline, and the flowers
borne in large terminal
panicles towards the end of
summer. Catalpas love a
rich soil and abundant
moisture. They are
particularly well adapted
for planting on the margins
of ponds and water-courses.
All the species have this
peculiarity: they never
form a terminal winter bud.
In consequence of this,
every shoot branches at its
apex into two or three
every spring, with the
result that the trees
naturally acquire a broad,
spreading habit. This is
especially apparent in the

position, it may be
mentioned, in which
Catalpas are seen to
exceptional advantage. In
the forests of North
America, where they are
drawn up by other trees,
the Catalpas occasionally
attain to heights of 50
feet to 100 feet. In
gardens it may sometimes be
advisable to help them to
reach a moderate height, by
keeping them to a single
lead when young. All the

cuttings of the roots, or

only produced after
exceptionally sunny

It was raised in the Royal
Gardens, Kew; hence the
name, C. Ardoini being the
seed parent. It is only
suitable for the rock
garden, where its slender
shoots can spread out and
form a mantle of soft
colouring, or to make a
spreading group on the
grass. There is little
trace in it of C. albus,
except in the flower
colouring. This is a Broom
for all good gardens.</td>

"leggy," and is very dense.
The big groups of it on the

Kew, are one of the
delights of the spring
season there. The ordinary
shrubbery is the worst
place for it, all its
gracefulness is lost, there
is no fountain of flowers
from the slender shoots. It

<td class="bl vtop">Cratægus (Thorns)</td>
<td class="bl vtop">Rosaceæ</td>
<td class="bl vtop">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="bl br  vtop">The Cratægus family
comprises nearly 100
species and varieties,
contains some of the most
beautiful of small garden
trees, both with regard to
the charm of their white,
pink, and scarlet flowers,
and the scarlet, black, and
yellow fruits. Most of the
Thorns are either large
shrubs or small trees, and
are specially suitable for
small gardens, whilst none
of them require particular
attention, as all will grow
in almost any soil and
situation. Old trees
occasionally require to be
relieved of small wood and
decaying branches, and a
good top-dressing of manure
is beneficial sometimes to
those which flower and
fruit freely; but beyond
this Thorns need no
attention after they have
been planted and
become established. The
species can be increased by
seeds, which are obtained
by gathering the fruits
when ripe, and mixing them
with sand. The mixture of
fruits and sand should then
be put in a heap in a
sheltered place
out-of-doors, and covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
with a few turfs. By the
following spring the fruits
will have rotted, and the
seeds can be separated and
sown. A fair proportion
will germinate the first
year, and the remainder
the second. Many of the
Thorns can also be
propagated by root
cuttings. For this purpose
healthy, vigorous shoots,
as thick as a man's finger,
should be obtained in
autumn or winter, and cut
into pieces four inches to
eight inches in length,
cutting the end nearest the
stem flat, and the other
slanting, so that either
end can be readily
distinguished. These should
be inserted upright in the
ground, with the tops
nearly or just covered;
they soon form roots, and
grow into strong plants.
The genus is found
practically throughout the
temperate region, from
Europe throughout the East
and Central Asia to China
and Japan, and in North
America. One species is
found in Mexico&mdash;but this,
and in fact all the Thorns
are hardy in this country.</td>

<td class="bl br vtop">Somewhat resembling the
dwarf-growing Genistas is
this extremely rare and
pretty little shrub. It
grows very slowly, and
seldom attains a height of
9 inches, spreading out in
a mat-like mass rather than
growing in an upward
direction. The branches are
short, stiff, and spiny,
and what few leaves there
are are small. The pea-shaped
blossoms come from
the axils of short, spiny
branches, and are blue.
This plant has been in
cultivation for a great
number of years, never,
however, having become at
all common. This is no
doubt due to the great
difficulty there is in
propagating it. Seeds
appear to be the only means
of increase, and these are
borne very sparingly even
when the plant is growing
under natural conditions.
It has been said to be a
tender plant, but it has
withstood several winters
out of doors at Kew without
injury. Plants are to be

<td class="bl br vtop">Mr. Bean writes in <i>The
Garden</i>, May 19, 1900, p.
361, about this species as
follows: "I do not know if
there is any authenticated
instance of its having
flourished in Britain or
even in Europe, most plants
so called being H. hispida.
It was first found on the
mountains of the most
southern of the main
islands of Japan, in the
province of Higo, and may
possibly not be quite so
hardy as H. hispida.
Judging by pictures and
dried specimens, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
racemes, whilst having much
the same general character
as that species, are
shorter, broader, and more
branched, and the flowers
are not so numerous on the
branches of the racemes,
and the fruits are more
downy than bristly. The
flowers have the same
one-sided arrangement on
the racemes."</td>

they differ, however, in
having the corolla almost
lobed to the base. Very
distinctive is the
seed-vessel, which has but
two prominent wings, the
other two being only
rudimentary. Whilst not
perhaps equal in merit to
H. tetraptera this species
appears to have been
undeservedly neglected. Its
dwarf bushy habit will also
render it more suitable for
some positions; it loves
abundant moisture at the
root. It blossoms rather
later than H. tetraptera.</td>

<td class="bl vtop">White</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">This belongs to the Asiatic
group of Halesias, and is
very distinct from the
American species. It is a
vigorous shrub, a small
tree with large oblong
leaves, and small flowers,
which are very numerous on
the raceme, which is 4
inches to 8 inches long.
One striking peculiarity of
the raceme is that the
flowers are arranged on the
upper side only of its
branches (a somewhat
similar arrangement is seen
in Freesia flowers). The
seed-vessels are covered
with bristly hairs. Mr.
Bean says, "Whilst
perfectly hardy at Kew in
the open, it blossoms more
freely on a wall. The
finest specimens I have
seen of this Halesia are
growing near a
carriage-road leading to
Mr. Gumbleton's house and
garden at Belgrove,
Queenstown." It flowers in
this country in June.

racemose than fasciculate,
and whilst they are very
abundant they are not so
large as in H. tetraptera

white and Snowdrop-like.
The seed-vessels are only
slightly and unequally

therefore, the species is
easily distinguished from
its two fellow American

Every winter the wood made
the previous year is
thickly cased with the
bright orange-coloured
berries, which remain on
the branches all the
winter, but later on, if
hard frosts are
experienced, they lose most
of their brightness. It
must not be forgotten that
the flowers are unisexual,
<i>i.e.</i> those of one sex
only are borne on a tree.
Male trees therefore do not
produce berries, and to get
fruit a female and male
must be near. In each
group, say of about
half-a-dozen plants, one
plant should be male and
the rest female. This is of
the utmost importance, and
see to it before the plants
leave the nursery. The Sea

results from keeping it to

<td class="bl vtop">......</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">There is no need to praise
the laburnum; it is one of
the most beautiful of all
trees, and its countless
flowers make a shower of
gold in early summer. It
seems strange to read that
the laburnum is not a
native, for it is so
general in gardens, and is
even used in hedgerows in
some parts of the country.
We have in mind a hedgerow
in Berkshire with
laburnums rising above the
thorn, and a pleasant sight
this is in late May and
early June. Laburnums grow
so freely almost everywhere
that they are somewhat
overdone in gardens, but it
is so beautiful a tree that
many would say: "I don't
mind how many laburnums I
have in the garden." Mr.
Goldring, writing in the
"Gardeners' Magazine" about
laburnums, says:&mdash;<br />
<br />
"Besides the common way of
growing the laburnum as a
shrubbery or plantation
tree, it may be put to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
various other uses. It is a
beautiful covering for a
wall on the north, east, or
west sides. In some old
gardens one meets with huge
trees of it covering large
areas of wall, and
affording a lovely sight at
flower time. This is a
common way of growing it on
the Continent, and in some
of our old botanic gardens
it may be seen trained
against a wall as a host
for the wistaria, which
flowers about the same
time, and produces a lovely
contrast of colour.<br />
<br />
"I have pleasing
recollections of seeing it
in some old gardens trained
over a path as a covered
way before pergolas were in
vogue in this country. For
several weeks such covered
pathways are glowing with
colour, and for the rest of
the summer they afford a
pleasant shade. In some of
the old Sussex gardens
laburnum 'tunnels' are
still to be seen, and they
are worth imitating in new
gardens.<br />
<br />
"Of the two commonly grown
species of laburnum, L.
vulgare and L. alpinum,
there are numerous
varieties, differing more
or less from the types,
though the differences in
some cases are slight, even
from a garden point of
view. A laburnum is a
laburnum to most people,
and nothing more, but there
is a great difference
between a worthless
seedling with short flower
clusters of a poor yellow,
and the varieties such as
Watereri and Parksii which
bear racemes fully 16
inches in length, and of a
rich-toned yellow. There
is, unhappily, in gardens,
a preponderance of inferior
seedling trees, because
they can be raised easily
and sold cheaply, but it is
better to have one grafted
tree of a first-rate
variety than a dozen
inferior kinds.<br />
<br />
"The number of named
varieties of L. vulgare
enumerated in Continental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
and English nursery lists
exceed a score, and most of
them are mere monstrosities
of leaf-form or colour,
only appreciated by the
collector of curiosities.
The finest varieties are
those named Alchingerii,
giganteum, Carlieri, and
grandiflorum. Any of these,
if true to name, are the
kinds to plant. They all
bear very long racemes,
produced abundantly."</td>

the most beautiful and
distinct of all our hardy

occurs over a considerable
extent of country in North
America, and when suitably
situated attains a height
of 130 to 140 feet. Though
these dimensions are not
reached in this country,
specimens nearly 100 feet
high are known, and its
great value as a timber
tree has been demonstrated
here as well as in the
United States, where it is
given the name of the White
Wood. The yellow Tulip-like
flowers, from whence its
popular name in this
country is derived, are
very pretty, but as a rule
borne at such a height that
their beauty cannot be
seen. They, however, add to
the interest and charm of
the tree, and with the
handsome leafage and the
rich yellow hue of the
foliage in the Autumn, as
well as its thorough
hardiness and almost
complete indifference to
soil and situation, make it
one of the most desirable
of our large growing trees.
There are several
varieties, notable among
them being integrifolia, in
which the distinctive lobes
of the leaves are
suppressed; aurea maculata,
whose leaves are blotched
with yellow; and
fastigiata, which is of
upright growth. These are
all interesting, but not

Hillsborough began his
experiments with such forms
of the Pernettya as were
then in cultivation, and he
selected as his first
seed-parent P.
angustifolia, a native of
China, a densely branched,
narrow-leaved evergreen
shrub, growing to a height
of about 3 feet. The fruit
of this species is light
pink in colour. It is a
very effective subject,
thriving well under the
shade of trees, but in such
a position does not, as
might be expected, flower
so freely as when grown in
the open. P. mucronata, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
type, bears reddish-tinted
fruits. Regarding P.
angustifolia as the
hardiest of the two,
Mr. Davis made this the
first seed-bearing
parent, and found the seedlings
from it to vary
considerably in the
character of the foliage
and colour of the fruit.
This encouraged him to
take seed from the best
of his seedlings, and
from it obtained the
fine varieties which are
now in our gardens. It
is difficult to
over-estimate their
value as berry-bearing
plants in autumn in
peaty soil.</td>

<td class="bl vtop">......</td>

<td class="bl br vtop">This is a beautiful genus.
As at present constituted
it contains all those trees
which were formerly and in
many places still are
included under the generic
titles of Amygdalus,
Persica, Cerasus, Padus,
&amp;c. The genus is divided
into six sections, viz.,
Amygdalus, which includes
Almonds and Peaches;
Armeniaca, the Apricots;
Prunus, which contains the
true Plums and the
Blackthorn; Cerasus, the
various Cherries; Padus,
the Bird Cherries; and
Laurocerasus, under which
is placed the Cherry
Laurel, Portugal Laurel,
&amp;c. Although these genera
may differ outwardly, yet
they are botanically of the
same character. The genus
is widely spread,
representatives being found
in Europe and through Asia
southward to Persia and
Afghanistan, and eastward
to China and Japan; it is
also well represented in
North America. With the
exception of the section
Laurocerasus, all the
members of the genus are
deciduous trees or shrubs
of various sizes, and most
of them are very beautiful,
especially in spring. A
fairly light well-drained
soil is best. If inclined
to be cold and heavy and is
not very deep, the plums or
any which succeed on the
plum stock, are best, as
they are more
surface-rooting than the
remainder. The presence of
lime in the soil is highly
beneficial to all the
Prunuses and, if not
naturally present, can
easily be given in the form
of old mortar-rubbish
forked in liberally round
them. Propagation is
effected by seeds,
cuttings, layers, or by
budding or grafting.
Details of propagation will
be found with each section.</td>

budding the Mussel plum
stock is the best to use,

thin to hold the bud
properly, which objection

The recent double-flowered

P. pseudo-cerasus goes
under several names, such
as Cerasus Sieboldi rubra,
C. Watereri, and others. It
is a small tree here, with
stout greyish branches, and
firm broad serrated leaves.

character. The flowers are
borne profusely, and
sometimes open in March. It
is a tree that could be
raised from layers. Mr.
Bean, writing in the
<i>Garden</i> of April 13,
1901, says: "Prunus pendula
is as naturally pendulous
in growth as the Babylonian
Willow is, and it should,
if possible, be obtained on
its own roots. It is an
early flowering
kind&mdash;probably the earliest
of the Cherries&mdash;being in
bloom as a rule soon after
April comes in. The flowers
are of a lovely shade of
delicate rose, but are not
large. They are, however,
freely borne, especially
after a hot, ripening
Summer and Autumn. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
United States it succeeds
even better than here, and
by some authorities is
regarded as the loveliest
of Japanese trees
introduced to that country.
So much cannot be said of
it in Britain, but it is
well worth cultivation for
its beauty and earliness."</td>

It is naturally a small

For lawns or shrubberies it
is excellent, making a good
companion plant to its own
countryman, the
large-flowered

beauty of the tree. It is
not only one of the best of
Cherries, but of all

well adapted for planting

Perhaps the most valuable

note that there is a

exactly opposite tendency,
branches and racemes being

<td class="bl br vtop">An important and beautiful
genus, as it includes the
Pears, Apples, and Quinces
of the hardy fruit garden,
and such trees as the
Flowering Crabs, the White
Beam tree, Mountain Ash,
and Pyrus japonica. It is
divided into seven
sections, viz., Pyrophorum,
which includes the true
pears; Malus, the Wild Crab
apples, parents of many
garden forms; Aria, of
which the White Beam tree
is a good type; Sorbus, in
which is found the Mountain
Ash; Adenorachis, which
only contains the North
American species, Cydonia,
the Quinces, and Mespilus,
with which is placed the
Medlar. These are found
practically throughout the
northern temperate zone,
under varying conditions,
and with one or two
unimportant exceptions, are
all hardy in this country.
The majority of the Pyrus
are trees of considerable
size. A few are small
trees, and about half a
dozen are low-growing and
dense shrubs. All are
deciduous, and will grow in
ordinary garden soil, but
none of them like a cold
and moist soil and
position. Ground that will
grow Apples and Pears well
will suit the Pyruses,
though they will thrive in
considerably poorer soil
than is recommended for
fruit culture. In planting,
the ground should be deeply
trenched, and the bottom
well broken up, any clay or
gravel that is encountered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
being thrown out and
replaced with good soil.
Most of the Pyrus root
deeply, and if the soil is
not properly prepared in
the first place they are
apt to fail and get
cankered. Propagation is
done by seeds, budding, or
grafting, and in a few
cases by suckers. The best
ways are given with each
section.</td>

<td class="bl vtop">Ericaceæ</td>
<td class="bl vtop">......</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">Very few of the species of
Rhododendron have not some
value either for out of
doors or under glass.
Rhododendrons are widely
distributed, species being
found in North America,
Europe, and through
temperate Asia as far south
as the Malay Peninsula, the
headquarters of the genus
being Western Asia and the
temperate Himalaya.
Rhododendrons also differ
greatly in size, some very
tall as R. arborea, which
is sometimes said to grow
to a height of 40 feet in
the Sikkim forests, to the
little alpine R.
Chamæcistus, which rarely
exceeds 6 inches high.
There is quite as marked
variation in the size of
the leaf, several species,
of which R. Falconeri may
be taken as a type, having
large and handsome leaves,
sometimes a foot high and 6
inches wide, whilst the
quaint little Japanese
species R. serpyllifolium
has tiny leaves not a third
of an inch long and of
corresponding width. The
Rhododendron family may be
divided into two great
sections, deciduous and
evergreen. The evergreen
section consists of a large
number of species, either
quite hardy or tender, the
tender ones being
represented by such
beautiful flowers as R.
griffithianum, Edgeworthi,
R. Dalhousiæ, R. Nuttalli,
the Malayan species, &amp;c.
With the exception of R.
ponticum true species are
seldom met with outdoors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
except in gardens where
collections are formed, or
in the south-west
countries. The scarcity of
species is doubtless due to
many of the hybrids being
much hardier, and begin to
flower and grow at a later
time of the year. Although
some of them will stand
severe frost in mid-winter
without injury, growth
beginning early in the
year, the young leaves and
shoots get considerably
injured by the late spring
frosts, and flowers when
open in March are also
destroyed or much spoilt.
In Cornwall, South Wales,
and parts of Ireland, huge
specimens of R. arboreum,
barbatum, grande,
Falconeri, griffithianum,
and others may be seen in
full vigour, but all have
to receive protection from
the north. Although these
species cannot be grown
successfully outdoors in
most parts of the country,
the hybridist knows their
value. Through crossing
them with hardier and later
growing and flowering
species many beautiful
hybrids have been raised.
Hardy evergreen hybrid
Rhododendrons may be
divided into several groups
according to parentage. Of
these groups by far the
most familiar is the one
that has originated through
the crossing and
intercrossing of the
Himalayan R. arboreum
with the American R.
catawbiense, the Caucasian
species R. caucasicum, or
the European and Asiatic
ponticum. This hybridising
has been progressing for
half a century or more,
and the parentage is
plainly seen in the
offspring. Thus where R.
arboreum asserts itself
most strongly we find rich
red flowers and leaves
with a silvery
under-surface. Where R.
catawbiense is most in
evidence the leaves are
large and handsome, deep
green, and softer to the
touch than R. arboreum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
while the clusters are
often of great size, the
flowers prettily spotted,
and the plants of
exceptionally good habit.
For very cold districts the
catawbiense hybrids are the
best, being hardier than
the others. The flowers of
many of the earliest of the
R. catawbiense hybrids are
of lilac or purple
colouring. The influence of
R. caucasicum is most
plainly shown in the rose,
white, and heavily spotted
varieties,whilst it also
imparts some of its sturdy
habit to its progeny. R.
ponticum shares with R.
catawbiense the honour of
producing many of the best
lilacs and purples, but
through so much
intercrossing it is
difficult to trace the
influence of any particular
species in many of the
newer hybrids. In this
group raisers are
fastidious, regarding the
shape of the inflorescence
as of first importance,
that is, a conical truss
of symmetrical outline, the
flowers on short stalks and
held firmly in the truss.
In the Rhododendron dell at
Kew many of these hybrids
are to be seen, and in a
number of the older ones it
is not difficult to trace
the influence of the
various species mentioned.
Some of those which show
much of the catawbiense
character are album
elegans, white with yellow
spots, delicatissimum,
blush, everestianum, lilac
with darker spots,
fastuosum fl. pl., double
lilac, and purpureum
elegans and purpureum
splendens, with
dark-spotted flowers. R.
arboreum blood is very
noticeable in the early
flowering, bright-red
nobleanum, the rich red
russellianum, and
russellianum superbum, the
white dark-spotted Baron
Osy, the blush or almost
white Blanche superb, and
many others, whilst R.
ponticum is in evidence in
a large number of hybrids.
In addition to this group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
there are others which,
though not so universally
grown, are quite as
beautiful. For a number of
years other species besides
those worked on to produce
the last-named group
have been taken in hand in
several places, notably at
Tremough by Mr. Gill, and
all who are interested in
shrubs know the great work
accomplished by Messrs.
Anthony Waterer of
Knaphill, John Waterer &amp;
Sons of Bagshot, Wm. Paul &amp;
Son of Waltham Cross,
George Paul of Cheshunt,
Fisher, Son &amp; Sibray of

<td class="bl br vtop">The group, in which the
Himalayan species
griffithianum, better known
as R. Aucklandi, is most
marked, is composed of a
number of large-flowered
hybrids which vary
considerably in size of
flower and colouring. It is
probably the finest species
of Rhododendron in
existence, and named in
honour of Lord Auckland, a
Governor-General of India,
by Sir Joseph Hooker. It
appears, however, to have
previously been named after
Griffith, the Indian
botanist, whose name it
ought now properly to bear.
It carries its flowers in
large, loose trusses, and
individually they are
frequently 6 inches across.
This Rhododendron, we
believe, ranks first in the
genus in regard to the size
of its bloom. Six or eight
of these are borne in a
truss, and they are pure
white when once fully
expanded, although pink in
the bud state. The handsome
leaves are smooth,
narrow-oblong, 6 inches to
12 inches long, and of a
deep lustrous green. When
fully grown this becomes a
small tree, the bark
peeling from the trunk in
large flakes. It is not,
unfortunately, one of the
Himalayan species that can
be grown out of doors near
London. In Cornwall and
similar places it is
magnificent. It only just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
escapes being hardy, and
can be grown out of doors
in tubs for the greater
part of the year. Some of
the best specimens in the
country have, in fact, been
grown in this way. Even
when placed under glass
little or no fire-heat is
needed. We know plants that
have stood 18° of frost
without injury. It is
remarkable that this
Rhododendron has not been
used more for hybridising.
Most people seem to have
been slow in awakening to
its value, and although, at
the present time, there are
doubtless thousands of
young hybrids from it in
existence, it will be some
years before they flower.
There are, however, a few
hybrids that are hardy and

<td class="bl br vtop">For many years the hardy,
deciduous Rhododendrons
were known only as Azaleas,
and in many places the name
Azalea is still maintained.
When the two
sections&mdash;deciduous and
evergreen&mdash;are compared it
will be at once seen that
there is no real structural
difference between them.
Although in the making of
the two genera the number
of stamens was considered
one of the principal
points, it has since been
shown that it is a point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
unworthy of notice, as the
number of stamens varies
considerably in both
deciduous and evergreen
species. It is doubtful
whether the name of Azalea
will disappear, but we are
following here the latest
classification, and
therefore place the
"Azalea" in its proper
group. About 20 species
have been known under the
name of Azalea, 3 or 4 of
which are evergreen, and
the remainder deciduous. Of
these about half-a-dozen
are really well known in
gardens, either by the type
plants, hybrids, or garden
forms. The majority of the
species belong to China and
Japan and North America,
one species being found in
the Caucasus. Several of
the North American species,
such as R. arborescens,
calendulaceum, nudiflorum,
&amp;c., the Chinese and
Japanese species R. sinense
(better known as Azalea
mollis), and the Caucasian
flavum (Syn. Azalea
pontica), have proved
splendid breeders, and in
the hands of the hybridist
a wonderful assortment of
varieties has been
obtained, which for
delicate shades and rich
self-colourings are
unsurpassed among hardy
shrubs. The colours range
from white to pink and from
pink to blood-red, from
lemon to deep yellow and
orange-scarlet, with all
descriptions of intervening
shades and combinations of
colour. From R.
calendulaceum most of the
orange and orange-scarlet
and red forms have
originated; flavum has been
responsible for many of the
yellows and terra-cottas;
arborescens, occidentale,
and viscosum for the whites
and pale rose varieties,
also for the late flowering
ones; while R. nudiflorum
has been responsible for a
great number of hybrids of
all shades. As a rule it is
much easier to trace R.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
sinense blood among hybrids
than that of other species,
the flowers in that case
being larger and the leaves
more closely resembling
those of the species, but
even in some of these
repeated intercrossing has
almost obliterated the
special sinense characters.
Many of these hybrids have
been raised in the
old-world city of Ghent, a
fact which has given rise
to the name "Ghent
Azaleas." In England Mr.
Anthony Waterer has raised
beautiful forms at
Knaphill, such as the pure
white Mrs. Anthony Waterer.
Few are named, however,
nowadays, this brilliant
group being called the
"Knaphill," and it is rich
in beautiful colours, from
white through yellow,
orange, buff, crimson,
scarlet, and other flaming
tones, which create
glorious pictures in the
garden in late Spring and
early Summer. The shrubs
should be planted in groups
in woodland and elsewhere
when the rich colouring of
the flowers is most
effective, and in Autumn
the foliage turns to warm
tints, crimson, brown,
purple, and other shades
intermingling, making the
bushes almost as beautiful
in their Autumn dress as
when covered with flowers
in Spring and early Summer.
Of late years these
Rhododendrons, especially
the sinense group, have
been much used for forcing,
and they are extremely
useful for that purpose, as
has been so well
demonstrated by the
brilliant groups exhibited
at various meetings of the
Royal Horticultural Society
by Messrs Cuthbert and
other firms. When planting
these hardy Azaleas, choose
a sheltered position, not
because they are tender,
but to protect the flowers
as much as possible from
cold winds and late frosts.
The majority of them are in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
bloom before the time of
frosts has passed, and
sometimes the flowers get
destroyed wholesale. Few
shrubs are more suitable
for planting in woodland or
on the fringe of walks in
single groups, as here the
colours are fully brought
out. A peat soil or a
mixture of loam and peat
will provide quite suitable
material. Mr. Anthony
Waterer writes as follows:
"In a general way all
American plants may be said
to delight in and to
require what is called a
peat soil; it was at one
time believed they would
not grow in any other.
Experience, however, proves
the contrary, and it is now
found that Rhododendrons
and Azaleas, which are the
most important of that
class, as well as any other
of the more vigorous
plants, succeed in almost
any soil that does not
contain lime or chalk. In
many sandy loams they grow
with as much luxuriance as
they do in peat; in fact,
almost any loamy soil, free
from lime or chalk, may be
rendered suitable for them
by a liberal admixture of
leaf mould or any fibrous
material, such as parings
of pasture lands. When the
soil is poor, thoroughly
decayed cow dung is one of
the best manures for
Azaleas." Seed pods should
be picked off immediately
the flowers are over.</td>

Professor Sargent, of the
Arnold Arboretum, collected
seeds of this type in the
mountains of Japan. The
young plants have proved
fairly hardy, but flower,
as a rule, too early to be
of any great garden value.
The well-known Azalea
am&oelig;na is the hardiest of
the varieties; it is easily
recognised by its reddish
hose-in-hose flowers.
Balsaminæflorum is dwarf,
and suitable for the rock
garden; it has pretty,
double, rose-like salmon

golden boss of stamens from

the fragrance is delicate.
The plant, although

not absolutely safe there;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
several specimens were
killed by the severe frost
of a few winters ago. A
certain amount of
protection is desirable,
but undue coddling often
leads to the plant rotting
to the root stock and so
perishing. The Romneya is
very impatient of root
disturbance. When once
established in the open
ground, however, it grows
strongly. The seeds take a
long while to germinate.
The plants may also be
raised from root cuttings
and layers. When growing in
the rock-garden it often
sends out shoots at some
distance from the parent
stem. Probably the best
site for Romneya Coulteri
is a sheltered one backed
by a wall.</td>

view, it forms a very
handsome specimen, the

tint long after most trees

Like many other Leguminosæ,
the deep descending nature
of its roots enables it

growth, and is therefore
valuable where rapid

Against a dark-tinted

Spanish Broom ripens seeds
freely, from which young
plants can be readily
raised, but as they make
very few fibres and do not
as a rule transplant well,
they should be put into
their permanent quarters

<td class="bl br vtop">This old favourite is often

In the type the flower

colour, varying to almost a
pure white in the variety
alba. In the variety
laciniata, known also as S.

other names, the leaves
are cut or coarsely
toothed. It is a beautiful
little shrub, and suits
a place where the tall

large. Like the common and
the Rouen Lilacs, it may be
forced into flower at
Christmas time, and, unlike
the others, its small size
enables it to be grown in

The exact length of time
the Persian Lilac has been
in cultivation is not

cultivated in the country
to which it owes its

<td class="bl bb br vtop" colspan="4">The common Lilac has been the glory of English gardens since the days of
Gerard and Parkinson of the sixteenth century. From the time that Parkinson
grew it in a pot, with no doubt as much care and anxiety as is bestowed nowadays
on a hundred-guinea Orchid, the Lilac has, on account of its extreme hardiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
and easy culture, become almost naturalised in these islands, as now we see it in
copse and hedgerow, besides gardens large and small, and even in the town forecourt.
To every place where the Englishman goes to make a home he likes to have
about him Lilacs and Roses. As in the case of several other beautiful shrubs, the
improvement of the Lilac by the raising of new varieties is of comparatively recent
date. Gerard and Parkinson write of the blue Pipe and the white Pipe (the Lilac
being then called the Pipe tree, on account of pipes being made from its wood),
besides the ordinary lilac-coloured sort, and Loudon, writing fifty years ago, only
enumerates the blue (cærulea), violet (violacea), the white (alba), and alba major,
and one double called alba plena, seven in all. He just mentions, however, a fine
variety, Caroli (or Charles X., as we know it), which about that time had been raised
in France. This still is one of the choicest sorts, and particularly valuable for forcing
into early bloom in winter. Since that time there has been great activity in raising
new kinds in France, till now the list of named single sorts numbers upwards of
fifty, while the doubles are almost as numerous. There are far too many named sorts,
in fact, as the differences between many of them are of the slightest, so that the selection
of the best from catalogues, from the mere names and brief descriptions (not always
accurate) is perplexing to an amateur. To no raiser do we owe more to the improvement
of the Lilac of late years than to that famous veteran French hybridist, Victor
Lemoine of Nancy, who has made the genus Syringa one of his special studies, and
favoured as he is by a climate suitable for the free seeding of the Lilac, he has been
highly successful. There are four more or less distinct shades of colour among the
sorts, viz. whites, reds, pinks, and so-called blues. A selection of a dozen single sorts
would include the following, placed in order of merit: <i>Whites</i>&mdash;Marie Le Gray, Alba
grandiflora. <i>Blue or Bluish</i>&mdash;Cærulea or Delphine, Duchesse de Namours, Lindleyana
or Dr. Lindley. <i>Reds or Purple-reds</i>&mdash;Souvenir de L. Späth, Philemon, Rubra insignis,
Mme. Kreuter, Camille de Rohan, Ville de Troyes. <i>Pinks</i>&mdash;Lovanensis, Schneelavine.
This selection comprises the finest sorts, having the largest flower clusters in their
respective colours, and is representative of the whole of the sorts. Of the double
flowered sorts there has of recent years been a great number sent from French
nurseries, and only a few of the oldest sorts have developed into large specimens,
and therefore one cannot judge of their merits, as in the case of the single sorts.
The best varieties include the following dozen sorts: <i>Lavender and Blue</i>&mdash;Leon
Simon, Renoncule, Alphonse Lavallée (pale blue). <i>Pinks</i>&mdash;President Carnot, M. de
Dombasle. <i>Whites</i>&mdash;Mme. Abel Chatenay (the finest), Mme. Lemoine, Cassimir
fils. <i>Reds</i>&mdash;President Grévy, Senateur Volland, Comte H. de Choiseul, Maxime
Cornu. In the Lilacs there is material for the tasteful planter of gardens, yet how
seldom does one see in ordinary gardens full advantage taken of them for producing
beautiful effects! In the common way of planting they are dotted about shrubberies
indiscriminately, and jumbled with trees and shrubs of a totally different
character, so that the Lilacs cannot be seen to the fullest advantage. An isolated
group of the choicest kinds, or even a simple hedge of the white or rich purple kinds
is seldom seen, except in some old gardens, and still less seldom does one see any
attempt at culture in the way of pruning and the cutting away of suckers. At Kew
one may see bold examples of grouping Lilacs, as well as well-developed specimens
standing alone on grass, while about London one sees in the market gardens fine
hedges of Lilac planted for the twofold purpose of cutting from and providing
shelter. Mr. Goldring writes in <i>The Garden</i>, "The most beautiful Lilac hedge I
have seen was that I enjoyed recently at the White Farm, Crichel (an enclosure
devoted to white animals), where there are glorious hedges of the pure white Lilac
Marie Le Gray in abundant flower&mdash;quite appropriate to the white surroundings.
The only culture the Lilacs require is occasional manuring in light, poor soils, occasional
pruning so as to induce a bushy growth, as the growth is apt to become
'leggy,' and continuous attention in cutting away suckers, which are so plentiful as
to rob the tops. Two or three suckers should be allowed to grow so as to keep
up the supply of strong, vigorous flowering stems. Lilacs can be made to form
standards by keeping the bush from the outset to one stem, and when seen rising
out of a low hedge of Lilac, or a mass of the dwarf kinds, they have a pleasing effect,
and is one of the various ways they can be arranged in planting."</td>

<td class="bl br vtop">A charming shrub, not half
enough grown, owing, in
some respects at least, to
a wide-spread idea that it
will not flourish away from
the sea-coast. True, it
luxuriates there, but it
may be depended upon to
thrive anywhere unless the
soil is a stiff clay,
chalky, or too much parched
up in the summer. It is
deciduous, but during the
Summer the foliage is as
delicate as any of the
Conifers, and in May, when
the branches are terminated
by the waving plume-like
panicles of pink blossoms,
it is delightful.
As a plant for the
waterside it is most
useful, and forms a
pleasing picture if a score
or so of plants are grouped
on a lawn or open stretch
of grass. In such a
situation the long
straggling shoots must be
shortened back occasionally

height of 10 to 15 feet.
There are several forms of
Tamarisk, by some
considered distinct
species, and by others as
forms of T. gallica, but a
good deal of confusion

One of the best (perhaps
the very best Tamarisk) is

includes several beautiful
shrubs, and of the thirty
or forty species and
varieties in cultivation at
least six are
indispensable, <i>i.e.</i> no
good shrub garden is
without them. Most of them
are vigorous in growth and
easily propagated; they
like a fairly rich soil
and moisture at the root.
Several of the American
species grow naturally in
damp, more or less shady
woodlands. Taken
collectively the Viburnums
possess a variety of
attractions. Some species
are evergreen, and thus
useful Winter plants;
others are amongst the most
beautiful shrubs for their
flowers, others again, like
our native Guelder Rose (V.
Opulus), have showy fruits;
finally the foliage of
several of the deciduous
species dies off rich red

var. sterile). Many of
them, however, bear very
showy fruits in their own

turn to beautiful Autumn
tints. V. dentatum is
deciduous, free-growing,
leaves bright green, deeply
toothed and strongly
veined. The trusses are 3
inches to 4 inches across,
the flowers white, and
fertile. It is one of the
handsomest as regards
flowers of the American
Viburnums. The dark-blue
fruit ripens neither
abundantly nor regularly

Its chief beauty is in the

Autumn. The fruit, at first
black and afterwards red,
soon disappears before the

rapidly and generally
attains a height of about
12 or 15 feet; the leaves
are large and downy. The
wayfaring tree should be
more planted in English
gardens. It will grow
almost anywhere. There are
two variegated-leaved
varieties, but these we
know little about, and we
care more for the type than
any golden variegation.</td>

<td class="bl vtop">China and Japan. Introduced from China in 1844 by Fortune</td>
<td class="bl vtop">Pure white</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">This must be included, but
it is not very hardy. Mr.
Bean, writing of it in <i>The
Garden</i>, November 17, 1900,
p. 361, says: "The shrub
known under this name is a
cultivated form of a
Chinese species, in which
all the flowers have, under
artificial influences,
become sterile. The wild
plant to which it belongs is
also in cultivation, and is
known as V. Keteleeri. In
this type plant the middle
of the truss is filled with
perfect flowers, the edges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
only being occupied with
the large and showy sterile
ones. V. macrocephalum is
by far the most striking
plant, its large, rounded
or pyramidal trusses of
pure white flowers being
unequalled among the
Viburnums. The plant is,
however, better adapted for
growing in pots for
greenhouse decoration or as
a wall plant than it is as
a shrub in the open. In my
experience it is scarcely
hardy enough to assume its
best character without some
sort of protection.
Although hard winters may
not kill it outright they
seriously cripple it. It is
only in recent years that
it has attained popularity,
but it has long been
known."</td>

<td class="bl vtop">V. Opulus (the Guelder Rose). It is called in America the Cranberry bush or High Cranberry</td>
<td class="bl vtop">Britain, Europe and Northern hemisphere</td>
<td class="bl vtop">White; May and June</td>
<td class="bl br vtop">Of the two species of
Viburnum this is the better
known, and is the more
valuable as a garden shrub.
It grows to a height of
from 10 to 15 feet, and is
easily known by the
beautiful lobed Maple-like
leaves, which die off
brilliant crimson shades.
Sterile as well as fertile
flowers are produced on
each truss, the flowers
being white and
three-quarters of an inch
across. But the wild
Guelder Rose is in its
fullest beauty in Autumn
when the fruits change to
brilliant red, and the
leaves gradually assume
their gorgeous colouring.
As this species appreciates
moisture it is a noble
shrub to make groups of in
moist places, such as by
stream, pond, river, or
moist margin. The beauty of
the wild Guelder Rose is
not realised by many
planters of gardens. Its
colouring is intense. In
the "Cyclopedia of American
Horticulture" it is
mentioned: "Handsome native
shrub, very decorative in
fruit, which begins to
colour by the end of July,
remains on the branches,
and keeps its bright
scarlet colour until the
following Spring. The
berries are not eaten by
birds."

weight of the rounded
flower trusses. As in the
case of V. macrocephalum
and of V. plicatum the
small and insignificant
fertile flowers have become
transformed by cultivation
into large barren ones, and
the truss also loses its
flattened shape and becomes

tomentosum as plicatum is a

tomentosum itself is a
handsome shrub with big,

creamy-white sterile

plicatum, a sterile form of
V. tomentosum, is a
beautiful shrub; the most
precious perhaps of the
whole family. It makes a
glorious group on the lawn,
and in early June the
spreading shoots are so
thickly covered with flower
clusters that scarcely a
vestige of the dark-green,
wrinkled leafage is
visible. It is quite hardy,
but in the north it will be
wise to choose a sheltered
position for it. As a wall
shrub too it is valuable,
and a specimen on a wall in
the Royal Horticultural
Society's gardens at
Chiswick is quite a mass of
bloom every year. Passers
by who know not the shrub
wonder what it is making so
thick a mantle of white. It
grows 4 to 5 feet high in
the British Isles, taller

trusses of flowers are

flower the bush has a
certain beauty owing to its
shining green leaves. Near
London it succeeds. Many
things considered hardier
get severely injured when
the Laurustinus escapes.
North and easterly winds
are harmful to it. There
are several varieties.
Lucidum is the finest; the
leaves and corymbs are
larger than those of the
type, the former being of a
very glossy green and
smooth. In lucidum the
leaves and branches are
woolly, whilst there are
also purpureum, with
purplish leaves, and a
variegated variety, but
neither is of value.</td>

seldom seen in English
gardens. The following note
appeared in <i>The Garden</i>
about it: "This tree does
not appear to be widely
grown, and I have heard
doubts expressed as to its
being hardy enough to stand
the winter in some
districts. Not long ago I
saw a fine specimen in a
Kentish rectory garden. The
tree is 5 feet or 6 feet
high, and under the shelter
of a thick hedge of
Laurustinus it flowers
freely every year, and also
produces fruit. The long
white and slightly tinted
blooms, which change to
purple, are very effective,
but one rarely gets an
opportunity of seeing this
interesting tree in flower.
Perhaps this is because it
does not belong to the
common order of things, or
else it is not
accommodating enough for
general culture, but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
very beautiful." The
Xanthoceras is sometimes
trained against a wall, but
its growth is too stiff for
the purpose. The flowers
are in dense spikes about 6
inches long, reminding one
of the Horse-Chestnut, and
are an inch across
individually. The foliage
is very ornamental, and
each leaf-stalk has seven
pinnate, serrated,
bright-green leaves. Apt to
get spoilt by frost,
however.</td>
